fifty one years old to day is november twenty fourth night two thousand nine ring he soon texas and i am elizabeth golfing and you got to talk to us about some women in your life then we manny family and having made me be who i am and oh i should throw said cause i don't know two of their names i don't know my great grandmother's name and she is the one who raised my mom for a long time and she was in ah in mexico the other side of the radovitch a just man was my mam was danusia and her ma was crazy she was gessoriacum we bounced around from a lot of relatives to relatives and she ended up with her grandmother for a long long time and i don't know her name the grand poker just been cranmother name her tourier and color anything i never know about her i never met her or anything and a bit just went told me stories about her and whose stories that she would tell me about her was that she didn't know how to count her grandmother did know how to count and she didn't know how to read or write anything and oh she did however know how to count to ten and she did know how to say her abyss and she taught them to josephina real early and she made tis she would say that you know jose wasn't going to be like her that she was going to know how to read and her grandmother made though the speares rant and that's how she supported the family and she made she would genotten as she would make ten of the us and then she would put a beam in a cup and then shown matemore and make put another man and she did it all day and then when the restaurant man had to pay her he would give her she gave him a being he regereris and she would give her onnontaeronnon how to say you owe me three dollars or you i i reached just go ben to ben to vesselmen to bess hatefu can and and that hossein of so she didn't know numbers but she still figured out how to basically run a small business and take care her family and she was a patchy except she married oh white mexican a spanish mexican and so she didn't get to stay a patchy she had to kind of come and it was a shame for her to be very towhit mexican so it was a harteman to be merran indian so they were just kind of on the outside a mere rybody ride but oh she raised using and what are the other things just when we tell me about her was that of the grammar they would wake her up every morning early early like four thirty or five o'clock to help get the stuff ready to make the theatre cause they had to go to the restaurant for lunch and she would wake riprarin she would tell her you know to help fixed up and then after that she would tell her to go sweep the batters the street for the mahaseer was a church across the long house or menino there was a church across the street and so she would make just bingo sweet the butte for thought for the nansemond okay but the nuns had had nero the oatmeal go sleep at gossamerland as that would pestof every morning should go verandahed ponteneuson about it then after she swept the but feel she had to go to church on it was like this six black mass or something right and so jose was always tired and she was always a she was never like not lazy but she was a lazy really but she lows really tired when his look it in so she would go to the church and she would when you were catholic and so she would go in and when you go in you keel down first and you say some personal prayers and then the guy starts and you do the the prayers all together and i think so she would kneel down and shoot put her fuller hands like she was praying and should put her head down as she closer eyes and she had stayed for a long time praying i pray no print she was as sleeman's rare old and then states pray aloud and to one in half his good grace she cost us weep erbout time she comes a praise all day and just let me hither she was asleep but the ah the priest re that from that parish the priest on he would go round to all the peoples in that parishes house and visit him mexico in mexico would eat sunday dinner with a different family every night and every sunday we week at josefa was really really poor and they ate beans and tottecan that's all that then once a year her grandmother would give her an egg and joshua she would eat like twenty of this trying to make them the egg last drake as she is asiatics going get it but when the priest came for sunday dinner they had to kill a chicken oh right and they would make more land you know refrains and everything the whole shell and the priest would come well they would throw the kids outside because they were going to eat the milliwatt pretend to go outside and so just me would be outside the window looking inside her house seeing the priest in there eating the chicken and chattier and think that's not chicken by the facer jeanest be mad so she always matter the presence was always made at the mohaves was a man her grandma but she was always met at them and that should all i think later on when she is so adult lismahago and wonder explains a lot of her avidities she had had a disrespect for the church on one saw it taking advantage of poor people but so that was her great grandmother a know sir grandmother was a my great grandmother and then it was there was her mother and her mother i don't know her name either who but her mother was katarina and she has just crazed and you know to be skitterin arado in nineteen thirty something with no medicine and no nothing oh she had come to to the use should come like sonontonheronons stuff where the head of the relatives and she'd gotten pregnant and married a man named floes from gaison and then when he got tired of her he reported her as a prostitute so they departed her ah and once you deported as a prostitute you could come back no more so she was stuck in mexico for ever now so she was just real mean to just men and i don't think it was cause she wanted to be meaner anything but she is didn't know she was just sick and she had a daughter who had kitardaji a sister and she loved that daughter put him on and both crazy gether he and just feelin wasn't trying to be crazy with them so she wasn't the fair one but ah so i don't know too much about that the her except that she is kitsune that she had some other kids beside just when she had the sister name letting it and it was good of nick she had another sister name i tashe had a son and as she had a second son and i don't know those those the sun names but the first sun a was born in mexico who and just rego back and forth from mexico to mexico us walentine on the bridge all the time and how one day he heard grandma gave her her baby brother a ham and said take him to your tea house and so since she went back and forth on the bridge every day the guards already knew the patrolman ardiune ry thing and so they were begetter goose's carrying the baby so they just let her go in and you know i how are you a letter go and then i noted that baby was mexican not american all so she took him to her the ashore and they went right away and they had him baptized on so that there would be a church record of you know he's only a few days old and so is lacunae wordable american right that her bertha brother grew up to be a border patrol gasolene after ameenoolla smuggler and that brother also grow to think he was her cousin oh well and that was something that was kind of weird a throughout step people who thought just to eat them a people who thought they were your brother but lay where your cousin and people but you they were your sister but they were your mother's onliss kunama they weren't who you thought you will you said they were give away the baby yet they were not a relative yes it they know that may be away in till she had another little boy after that dressing mother had another little boy after that and he died when he was about two or three and he died a starvation and so she this woman was scitare his are not well his norica she sitting there in her hut cushat was just you like a little the hut with a dirt floor and no glassoid ows and no door just a curtain and just out of the the montecassino with his dead baby so she sends joseph and to go to that same this house to say he of the baby died i need john to help me to bury him and stop and they never went well they never went nobody ever answered nobody ever went to go see what had happened the baby just sit there and rot away did she throw in a ditch not did she bury nobody ever saw nothing and that's my image of her i just was mom is being crazy and already had men not knowing what's going on in the world for real and then sitting there with your dead baby and nobody came and waiting for somebody and nobody came and just men had to a a cousin and the she always said that a in her i know her name and bidache always said that bet her cousin saved her life because she stopped having to go from house to house to house and she settled in with her cousin so she was about like fifteen and stuff and she she went to his cousin's house and the cousin was grown up and she was married and she had some sons and those little boys thought that josephine was their sister who but they were really her cousin and that cousin her husband was in war war to and so he was away in the service well when he was getting ready to come home josephine i had to leave the house and she didn't understand why this woman who finally took her in and was finally nice to her and and finally gave her clothes and and you know was nice to her and gave her her own room in her own food and everything all of a sudden she had to go just we had to go and so she didn't understand but she thought well maybe she wants to be alone with her husband or something so she left in a couple o weeks later and the lady had given up the cousin and me had given josephine a dress and who had addressed as she made down from her own dress she cut it and made it for justin so just we was goin to go show it to her and say look how pretty it fits within she kept saying no i better catch the busie was going to work in her no better go show tonometer catch the bus so she went back and forth like for half an hour and they only she allus goin to go so she went to the house and when she got there and meet us mother and her two sons were sitting on the porch and just went at a wary o doing and the lady said well we're sitting here because the doors locked businesse yet but that she liked the door shoreline so jostling got in and andreias layin on the in the dining room and her head she cutter neck and it was cut with the a sort a japanese sword that the hall had brought him but home from the war and her husband as she was in the house she was by herself everything was locked up just in had to break in and so nobody saw the husband there so it looked like that she had cut her own throat and she had childers but just we say when she went to go pick her up at her head fell back on and it was just holding on by like the skin at the base depends there wasn't no way that she cut her own neck all the way through the bonin everything we dried so that was the crazy husband and that's why she had sent josephine away because she didn't want her all to be near the crazy husband and the husband not only he killed her he suicide at her so she could n't be buried in sacred ground he made it look like liassic herself right and so she couldn't have no mass she couldn't have no nothing everybody was ashamed he took euph took even that and so then josephine after that she had she had a son whatever and when she had me to eternal and she did like the people did to her she gave her son away and she gave me away and then she would go get us back but she would give us away too and back and forth in pure for years i wildly with other people and for years her son would be with other people and then she would get us back and finally she got us back and we all she had us and her son was like six or seven years older than me and and oh he was he would have little friends over and he was like ten eleven twelve who ride and i was like six or five years old or six years old and he would have his friend over and they were starting to be teenager so they wanted to kiss girls and stuff right so her son would go get that neighbor girl and they would kiss and then his friends wanted somebody to kiss so her son just in son would give them me and they would pass me around and that was i was little i was like five and i lost my regina when i was five because he wanted to be popular because he wanted to say i have something to offer all he couldn't just have friends because they were his friends he had to have something to give them anyway so josephine what andesitic because the church was a block away and back then the you had to sit on different sides of the the church the men sadleirian the white one side so i would sit by myself and it was in latin word like as a elspeth noosheerwan so i know what they are doing it i can sit here all right whatever so just was a a drunk right and she was a really mean mean drunk she would hit his real hard she would have his road and and she would always hit me more because as soon as she picked up her hand her son would cry and then she wouldn't hit him but she would hate me and i wouldn't cry then and i was pissed off because i would tell you i i can't stop you from hitting me but i can't stop you from seeing me cry and so just put that god whom i wouldn't cry and so she would hit me more and more and she would and we are both just that gus you gotter go in on it and we just take going and the two things that were really big and bad that you could do in the house was you could take something from somebody else that giton tell you to go ahead and take and mostly that was cause we were i was in the bar joinal the time which just within a lower in the bear joined the drugs would try to give me a quarter or give me tickler say high little girl whatever and just we wouldn't let me talk to them so i couldn't take the quarter i couldn't take the nicolay i couldn't speak to them and lest she gave me permission and the other thing was i couldn't go somewhere unless i told her i couldn't eoster so she said messenio church one day and she had gave me two nickles and one nicholas her collection plate and one nicolas further by dona after the church in him so i came home winona would two donacona done on any ten we want i know eatingest men say and she saw me coming to the dry when she was already getting mad because she thought i had let somebody gave me a donator that i had stolen down at those other big thing we couldn't steal you could lie and cheat and kill people but you couldn't you know steal so ah so kind of the drawing were in i would mac you don't it and she's already getting mad and she says where did you get the donati bought it or did you get the done so now curse you think i'm lin your lin cause she always out of line anyway so now i lie no i bought it did you steal it no i didn't see it to somebody gives no nobody gave to me i bought it how did you buy it i only gave you nickname tonio well one case where the collection play yet one was confrontacion play wid you put in the collection plate cause i looked in there and they have onconnected obeyed kept my life a man myself you know i and just when she didn't laugh for nothing but she just looked at me and she said okay you've learned everything you need to know about them and gentleman the turk right then be the church and she didn't send me to church no more and i had barely barely started a sunday school yes and ah the only thing that i learned in sunday school the first thing they teach her riven your little like that is that jesus loves you right well i only got that jesus loved me in and i am here about he loved all yaller and so i was set that was it that was to my life aleaeus loves me cold we can do this and then it's all you needed this all i needed and that and that they had a bunch of theocles and i was over it and pisicelli i still say that i'm catholic and i still pray and i still do all that but i don't go to church for much and i think i'm probably not a good kind of catholic like they want me to be right because i'm not like guilty and sorry and and noble you know spinioning his stuff too i'm a kind of halloway how catholic ahem you know your house burned down and you say how loony right cause nobody died okay so the house burnt down and half of people died then you say well the other have to in the hall the any time and any way i smattering is though oh i don't do sort thing the coveter just like real happy with a kind of catholic that i am but i have with any to so we call but almost people all those women that made up all of that made up i can see those things in me cause her justin's grandmother didn't know how to count but she managed to count and jose's mother was crazy but she got through stuff anyway me and she sat there waiting for people to come bury her son now and nobody came and it shows up i think in me because i don't wait on anybody so and i i saw i think that's good oh i justify was drunk i don't think there's a hugenotti that but she was hard on me and she was mean and that gives me permission now to not care about people who are men so my boss ysame or the crazy lady at the stores i lee or somebody takes my parking space or whatever i am walian i grew up my mamma anyone like me too as barefaced ain't even to worry me and it just it just gave me permission not to care about a lot of stuff and not to have what the hell else can they do to me you know every horrible thing that could happen to a girl child happened to me twice give other himalayan so my bossies at me she oldtime to day and i think okay well that's you know well and i just kind of keep going on i think i if you'll only knew you i don't care if the signatories loves me i want her but your family though mine my grandmother's in very different well first cause you know their names right yes for started other names the grandmother did most of soame though it was my dance mother christina mendes oh she did speak any english i guess there's that in common how well she was its weird botho she was like second generation may be even third generation american from so the family has been here for a long time i'm just my theory as they were here when it was mexico right only the line move that's all oh but she never spoke any english but she understood it and i was very lazy as a child being a round spanish all the time you would have thought i would be just a very good spanish beaker a spanish i'm still learning um but we could wevenged to communicate she would speak to me in english i mean in spanish notes pet her in english ah i member what time staying at the house she would oh put me down for naps with you but all of us down for naps there were six of us but oh i hate it to take naps oh one summer afternoon i snuck out of bed i i i must have been all of a now four years old i just thought i was grown i went out the front door i go i was going down opposing way i was going down three houses to visit carleton give you know we all play together and it went even my friend was more brother's friend but his only friend on you on

read the sails to her watsonius say what is his say okay what about this ah as she drove i mean somehow she got her driver's license as it had to be the old test but ah she got a driver's license because even in spanish i mean she she could read a little bit now i guess it must have been like about i know second third grade level reading so she had just a very basic um another time when they were when she couldn't ha was it oh after growing up just without or have our old system worked out spanish english like i said i she would take us with her to help her out as you have to read the signs this street in a youths reet side sometimes if she's going to a new place or one time i was riding around with her and i didn't know where we were going i had just great was my first summer

also daughter and they all even out of his past away aerliks i have about twenty six fathers to they all keep an eye out for me he asked me how the careers going and what i should do i know who to go to fort five so that was is still around me to what is what in the things that like like i learned it jesus loves me your dad taught you when i lost yes he taught me a lot of different ways that's why amating always feel that music as is the soul speaking for one thing that is a direct connection to god and my love of nature i think came from my dad cause as a kid i re have this one memory to just so clear i was elsalill but when i told him about this for instance he i haselwood even talk yet so he so wassapinewat i had this man resole i remember him it was a clear like a winter night but the sky was reclenched all the stars and a member he was looking at the stars the back yard any held me in his arms that i would could look straight up else all my back and he goes to see all those almost arson the moon all that go yeanworthy about planets as to he says well god made that for you and like for me thus ye all that for you so that was kind of man all this is for you in daisies me if if he made all that and he loves we in coolies that was my moment we still live in that house yes i do yes we do where you get home your grandma had lived there for while at the house i got caught speaking out of olaneta was tense grew up in right and yes there was the house i grew up in and am i before dead passed away i asked him if i could buy it he was going to sell it to you or some renters anicette house really means a lot has a whole lot of memories there and so ah so he stood havenhaag yard where you saw the stars yes as the boat there i look now a bonny how come we're not married men you ah you think i'm paranoid that dad was so well known a lot of people know me i'm just so sure that the body i thee play in our weddying is your so famous amavisti your money on us a good to know you i you antony moriarty lingo ye how long are we been together all man what years is to thousand we first met in san ithent three at the performing arts here and houston heretico and dechtere been

latin of the t v so learned of the cartoons and the the news some sure i talk like butter conceit and not by her sometimes to but do you think i think that were old enough that that we remember when it was harder to be gay that kid that are coming out now all they have it so easy think comparison absolutely that's why i think i'm still kind of a question what the money at his tone as you yeh ah it was is a big thing and i just remember that ye try to come out and seventy six or something again when all my amy family thank god is dead and so on have to deal with anybody or anything saying anything but you lost everybody and there still around and there still really i unholstered who it when you came out so they has now because of that but they know before her ye but it's almost like
