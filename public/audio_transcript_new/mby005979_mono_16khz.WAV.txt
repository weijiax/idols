gosavis um i am fish generation his panic and am i when i was i was the first born on on my from my family and i could never say i lie that so i always called her ear and her husband my grandfather's name was blue and i couldn't say bo nooi called him womaan so the alix of us and my family called him he bondwoman so i will refer to my grandmother as he barumbu what i was have always been so impressed about her she was born in eighteen seventy five in mexico at age three she was orphaned a both her parents passed and i'm not real clear on the details of wide but of all of the family and those days used to be split up and given to uncles or aunts in her case her and a younger sister were given to her god parents and her god parentlike an a a large ranch on in the texas side who was then mexico boon the texas side and ah they live close to a lunch of the doses who was my grandfather's grandfather's ranch he had gotten an original langurant so my grandfather was born and in what is now the united states and his father was born in the united states also and was then texas so these two families knew each other and as it turned out the two sisters ah ebon my grandmother and the holier sister married the two brothers and a bruno woman being my grandfather she had was in a home a wife and run helping to run his ranch she never went to school she was a literate but my grandfather woman was a literate man he did not speak much english but he read any rode on he spoke beautiful spanish and um it was something that always bothered her and something we didn't really talk of blood about and i didn't realize her literacy until i became a little older but we and i in a ninety nineteen she had on her tenth child who was my mother she was forty four years old she was not expecting to get pregnant ah we understand through the stories that we hear from my my aunts who are older that she became very very depressed and though when my mother was born am she continued to her depression and when my mother was three months old she told my grandfather belabut she wanted to learn how to help women do ever and have babies and my grandfather said but you have in a liato take care of and she said i've just spoken to peter who was her oldest daughter the ape that i had just had a son a soul a hose and and my mother were about the same age and the apeared to to raise my mother and reseed her so so ah my grandfather was still hesitant and he said but you never studied and you can't read and she said i want to go speak to the doctor they lived in a in a tin of an ranshakle mc coy this was a south asenion but not in sandalwood where the latter lived and here i was born so he when in touch the doctor my grandfather did and the doctor knew her and he said well i'll tell you what i will give you a couple of medical books browne and i want you to read to her and to begin to teach her and her listen to the tour readings but in addition to that she can begin to go with me to deliveries and will see well within six months he was extremely proud of how quickly she learned how well she learned and am so she started delivering the bees and um she became in addition to delivering babies because she'd always lived on a ranch she also began to use the her ears that she would collect out on on on the ranch and in the end he and the out in property and began to use her ursorum of the children and the babies and the mothers that needed help so she provided after carhayes she provided after care as well as a delivery and dum after about figety mother says she was about seven they left him a coy and came to some teevan they lived in a luncheon why they move oh my my mother says that my dad my grandfather woman had an estrangement with his father over some land but when my grandfather passed ah ah papa look woman was needed to go back to run the rest of the ranch and there was no one else to take care of the ranch so he came back and took over a ventose ragusa was as it was called and in that period of time there were small ranches all around that area and duval county and james county and and all of the counties around there they were small towns but the ranches were all around and each of the ranches had small a communities of live there may be six or seven families so my grandmother went back and um she started delivering babies and in in the different ranches but my first memory um of her actually learning was one day i recall as a child i was in her kitchen and my grandfather had the dimetia book and and she was cooking and working at at the counter and and making her goodhearted she was doing and he was reading to her and and in spanish and she suddenly said nobleness montanto they militario understand tell me again and she stopped and she looked at him and he repeated it and she asked questions and that's when it first occurred to me she can't read and she has learned to deliver babies and to use herbs just by what he has read to her and he has taught her from these two books that he has had and then i started really attending to the way the community treated her doctor dunlap and doctor they are as were the two doctors in the town an by then they had left their aunt jo and the ovaire in living in an the ole and doctor don lapon doctor they will is never delivered any child without her being there many times though the husband of the of the woman to deliver would come first i remembers specifically am more than one night but one every specifically or remember the banging on the door at ooelite allat lead that the nearly dies the impressible which meant that the husband was there to tell her that she needed to come and i used to sleep in if i spend the night with her i would share a bed with her and if one of my brothers spend the night go then they would share a bed with my my grandfather who slept in a separate bedroom so i sat up because i do not heard the noise and she got out of she immediately got out of bed she and papa would no got up and ah he said lolita is in no yes say yellow i heard him and she took off her nightgown she put on her little her little arm the cotton dress i remember shewas war kind of a waste line dressed she had very long hair and she stood in front of an old fashioned britannia she brushed her hair and then she tied it in a mat and and made a top knot twisted it around the top of her head and put it pins in it and and she kind of put a little powder on her face by jury washed up and all that is shaamed icin bag and his that way was during that period i started noticing the medicine bag and she said too and wawasa up also making some coffee for her and she's heise said nothing with the employaient have time for the coffee with that with that aninga care of the child he may bask on the way is you will see me when you see me and she left and more than one doctor dunlap or doctor there was would be coming and common saint thing knock at the door in a alienable and they would they would take her because she didn't drive so either one of the doctors took her or ah the husband of of the woman who was delivering would take her in all the deliveries were done at the homes and am mammy grandfather would always if one of us was spending the night with him he would fix his our breakfast and and indeed she came when she came on and she did this she was forty four when she started delivering the babies and she died at eighty four but she delivered babies my mother says and i can i was a teen ager free teenager so till i till her lake seventeenth i would say and i remember the family's in the community who would come and many times before they would see a doctor they were come to see her and ah she would um they would sit in the living room and she would they would tell her what the problem was with the baby and she would recommend herbs and some of them she had gone out and picked herself out in the woods others she had purchased it she had little boxes of the menheer all labeled a we go ahead age deliver helped to deterierate is she ill ever all has she delivered all of us all of her grand children that were born after she started delivering yes and i was born premature um and only wait a little over five pounds but she delivered me and she designed a small shoe box and she put to my mother said and in order to keep me very warm and she wrap me up and put me in this little shoe box so that one i would be as warm as i needed to be because i wasn't going to a hospital and i wouldn't be in neupeter but she knew enough to know that i needed to be very warm and down so yes she delivered all of us were you there when the other getters were made now because oh my mother would always go to her house and when it was time for my mom when my morwen into labor my dad would take her to easthouse and then he would come back and an take it be with us while mother was delivering because a woman will awast my grandfather was always with mother for all the deliveries in mother used to always tease my dad about the fact that la was here for all the deliveries but but he never was and my dad said i just discount watch you go through that pan oh and i guess as a kid i never thought about what she was doing until as an adult if to it has felt very powerful to me that she was so brief and so strong and that she wanted to do this and oh nothing was going to stop her and she always figure out away i re recolember her being somewhat distant and very but very focused in very self that there is centred um we had a lot o respect for her boay grandfather was much tender and closer and gentle and kind and not that she was unkind out mean that but she was just always busy focus had things to do ah so i guess that's what i wanted to ahtose and elaboration of foam did the people in the ranches carinatae namely our abihail i guess that to be called athon yar and in the anolidae name was at the litanies a short name for the lighter in a community like that to be called doing a althotas was a was a title of respect so our cause i don't recall any one in my whole town referred to as going out except for her and every one in the computer to refer to her as though in analytic for people who were close to her you know would callerio call rebind or ma ma alistair cousins we call here an i let that but but all her patience reclines her customers however you want to call it they all called the a a which had a leveret you remember any of the stories of the some of the other people in the the tone to about her well i i just know that a doctor though you and doctor done lap who were licensed physicians ah had a great level of respect for her oh in that as i said they would not deliver a babe without her being with them oh even though the outdoor dunleary always have a nurse come in ten was was his doors but ah epas always with him also and and she only lost one mother on both the mother and the child did not survive and my mother says that she would say he poitain he told me this but most as she would say to the day that she died she would cry and grieve for that one woman that did not make it because all the others and how many there were i don't know because it was director kept of the offer to liveries she didn't write and therefore in others no record of it you there is any body else hottentottos about well i as you know i i've ad since we have a little time my father i wanted to tell something about my dad that i thought was very special ah when the second world war broke out he was he and i in my morangis just boring i just been born in forty one in march a forty one and december a forty one when the when the war broke out we were in living in chicago and he was working in the steel mills my mother was pregnant with my brother unmoved she did it was very cold as chicago and she did not like living there she wanted to come home and with the war breakin out he he so he brought her back to some day and he actually tried to join them a later but by then he was twenty nine and he had a child in another on the way and they did not accept him however in ninety forty two the kiersons in portland oregon sent out trains from forty one through forty three to south texas southern of southern arizona southern mexico and some california and took it took people that that needed work men and they came to corpus and my dad and ten of his friends went to corpus and they signed up to work the ship yards and portland organ and a train took em all the way to portland and when my dad was in the nursing home tears ago before he passed we knew he lived in portland when you he worked in the ship yards for two years and he wanted to stay and we you the home much you loved it but when he was in the nursing home and am he would be and as mary walker and he as you know he had to mention but sometimes who would be so clear about the stories who tell me and one day as we walk in the hallways he began to tell me about signing up with the kiss of shipyards and going not he said not really knowing or i was going to live and what the reginam but he said i knew i had to work and out of family to support and he said an we got on this train and we travelled across united states and he said the western united states is the most beautiful country he said i couldn't sleep because i just wanted to stare out the window and see the rockies and and the rivers and these magnificent mountains and he saw we got to portland we we came off the train and they took us to dormitories and that they were like houses that were built and they had small units were they before bedroom was an a small kitchen and we could cook their awe could eat at the ship yard because he a wonderful cafeteria he said were treated sarily were paid well and and it was i he said he was a i was so proud to be doing this work he had three brothers in the navy and he said the ship would come

vancouver and he said i never seen such beautiful country in my life and i never seen country like that again and he wanted very much for my mother to come to portland to live there and bring our amalon myself but my mother was leave so after two years he returned back to some debut he always is to tell me there is a huge world out there gassela be must get out sit leave this town to see it and indeed as you know we have travelled from any ponies cosseins re to do that to a allower you in all you others sisters all graduate from college goes all yes and and do you think was because of of of of of what he had experienced he you know raised us the sex he us and his his desire for us both him an my mother but my dad let it was that we must become educated and he used to tell me you i i

you both root and wings yes absolutely he gave me put sowings and in so did my grandmother thank you to i shall cast one more question to me grandmother on can you describe what she look like ter yes she she was not very tall and how was patitur and am in for god but she was not very tall may be five to three she was a little in the rounded and not use was she was firkin not dark skin but fairskinned and at her hair of course because she anew her when she was older was stark white i was very very long um her her hands were those hands that of some one had worked a lot she everypody face remember that and she had kind of light colored eyes oh so kind of a soft brown as my grandfather was darker and with much taller he was almost six foot and together they would make quite a combination cause he was so much taller than her and she loved music and she loved to dance she loved to dance on so i member that my mother would tell stories about when they went awaiting with as a big thing when they were weddings or baby showers or things they would they would actually families to get together in the big music and dancing because my grandfather did not like to dance he would allow her to dance with other men and are his friends and and her sons are old reasons oh because we wouldn't dance but a a would she mother said she was like a top but she would just that you also said that that was a reason that he marked a coded because he could dempesy mother and my dad a wonderful dancer is he so that was one of the things that attracted her to him that they both loved music and and could dance no lease or lose the story about how they ah how how she asked him has him to go to proesce blonde my dad's brother as he was a man to what they call him bandeaus she was kind of a kind of a fair skin guy so it was bandy anyway um on colony and mother were in school together and she needed a high a day for the prom and and she had seen that y before a mansion new daddy in town and she'd seen him at dances and she'd seen how she was a good dancer and she always conelike because curly dark hair and she thought he was a handsome guy so she and my mother was very was is still very very beautiful and she sat tornabuoni i know but er man wanting was to your brother in moliere ll like to get to know him better and so um uncle andy went to my dad and said o wife ale that was his anointers ted in you she thinks she'd like to take you to the prom and so she said that very evening he came knocking on her door and he said lily to a blonde tells me that you would like to day for the prom i'm willing to take you as sowanowane first there first day no no you go are you grew up in big in the end in a little town called san diego correct yes um to you could you could you tell us a little bit about or why people may recognize them then the town santiago and the county of devol well i guess you referring to the george parsons they do of the wall how i grew up in the forties and the fifties when ah there was a family called called the part of the paris paris georgian archie bark and they were political ah what would you call him goose in in this in this entire county um and there you know eventually they there were some they were criminal things that were brought at up against them but on during the time that they were controlling the town actually was a very thriving little town my father never had any connection with the pars um but a some a couple of my uncles did but yet when people think of devachan anyone who knows much and much about texas will will know about the pars and um there's always the story about that in some less oh vote box that that helped johnson become senator that it was because of that but box thirteen i believe it was and dealhunty that that put johnson over so that he could become a senator a w it's it's i rage that the ah the bowed box all the happened an diego and within johnson became the president and he signed the education the illahee undoffable to become educated as i i've always had great respect for president johnson because he really knew about his panic who need he knew he knew the help that we needed and because he did teach in a small town and was texas so he knew an so i think or question about your your grandmother overseeur overtheway what have you learned from her and your life i have learned about working hard about being focused about having a goal and in allowing anything to stop you and i have actually my life has been guided both by what i saw her as a woman and by my dad but the other hard work the focus then that the ten having a goal and just going forward and in allowing anything to stop you and both my dad and my grandmother taught me that and you remember a idomene difficult but when she passed you remember when we whately fell with specifically when my grandfather died he died he had proskauer and he died first they had been together since she was seventeen and he was eighteen and he was eighty while she was eighty five and he was eighty six the light went out of her life she did not speak much after that she did not cook much she wouldn't ever listened to the radio when ouiche just gradually became more and more inside herself she was diabetic and um she developed a horn on her foot that became affected and the doctors said she would have to be amputated and she said no i will simply die and i realize now how much she suffered because basically going that happens you wait for your by could be poisoned and that i happened to hear that how she died but she did not want to go on living without him without use of her limbs was a fairy sad situation than you said for sharing these nothing else you like to talk no i think this is what i get way came and i think you
