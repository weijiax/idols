a good town to make a living head and so i came here and habanese no not had the good fortune to back in a nineteen seventy seven one two to meet a lot of a community people that were involved in a trying to help each other and have the community and you one of them well i ve been very fortune to have a also a concolor and in a city at heston independent co district and of course oh enter demolatry at the way back in the nineteen sixty two i was on the opposite side of the avenarius i was in germany a while in the service i became a communication sergeant um and ah i wish in the attemptin on anne forty eight armour ah which we protected the borders and oh monomotapan with a very good experience pride to ben in the service o if i grew up m in these party heston and i got see a lot of major i have seen the rose of the city is pectinacea ity oh in i think that ah in the next one years ah heston has a pudentius in a leonteus in regard to the number of people and also as a mature a city of this country well know johnny this a city is gone allot but ah we have grown with it too and a i remember mechanist arted out the deletion community of the mixen community oh really was not having a lot of looking itinerates from anybody especially the east then and he that i think were i you and i had catenated to none not restrict orses but this is where we had most of our tivity and ah this is where we ah had the opportunity to start delatioun center to serve the side that didn't have any services at all the only other one there was repose but ah you you can't i expect to a communicator the entire stanitsa lot of population or they were not being served and so when when the alaginnies started by myself in the franco coin and ushered a big hand in an gudness going ah it was something that i at the time was a not a pupating to for for a a communicating we started by private group but ah i think that time a governor memory president regan oh was trying to espouse the tetricae community should get behind social concerns and so the fog were doing at that time ah tell me exactly of for the benefit of the alisters oh oh a sort of a a the things at the latian and inner which they do corporation did ever on building or or oh exactly what was the mission of lintell you know well at the time we began we didn't have any experience and we did know quite hondekooter in the rememberer merle we had to friend who was an attorney and a we didn't know we could approach him or not so we talked to her one of his legal assistance and she was one that said well what you need to do is to incorporate it into an unpropitiating and form for him board and just be a separate into teather and of course we follow that advice and a wise of the corporation we we set up the awarders and we started to a race fontoreen that no deliberate bill in the way in and i were successfully the the corporations of really were supporting us and we tore classes we started classes a a computer operation of cartooning and different things and we we were successful and we also did our conditioning and it is electric colgates and just to all of things that help the community oh it funny you mention that but i i recently you know um com a counter library in the i go to them banders on can't yer sinner or hospital and i constantly run into a person's ada either unimitative and i will roam that went to some of those classes and they remembered some of the work that was done a particularly francoise moor in cracker that building that was the responsible in bringing the corporature and ah also the manichaeans i had had a rutter and um ah the matins are a lot of organisations i for one became lame i was a distributionism and had offices there and and oh we were able to oh operate out of that facility i with an otiose but johnny been in barwith aloof different things here in these the community since you were six years old and at some of the things that that he come to my right now that that ah have really impacted the community a or things like a leistered i remember when i got here and sixty eight i think it is started and a the and there were just about mabeuse six cars and there was about it and now it gontere of the largest in the country and is really well oh you know apreece and a lot of people religo for it it must it must feel a good miss bess asistencia of heaven been one of the irrigators well you know there's a lot of pride and the poacher because of a misconception in the way let the news had been stereotype in not only locally but in this country ah the fact is that i as of to day ah the poor potrain in the media are potrain ah soopernatural of arum the movie industry i have been the negative part to the gangster the prostitution in all that i hear a throughout the years and also with the assistance of em this panic media a specially capitulation and so papers ah and then through the efforts of guacara other ardeatians ah that is changing into the sense of a also have the pleasure of serving state director etexts we were able to toliatchi of malourea which was a national president and also one of the first execute rector of mount of a to make change is to be able to go to the sponsor for promoters and saying hay we don't want to be seen as the bad guys we we have judges we have no ears on and that's to the effort of a artistic did you yourself like um to ben a commander of american jerome licentiate and that he also strive and and work grey hard for veterans will you know un jelly one of things that the i a think i ah important but geraison with these men committee is your relationship to the media you everybody knows who you are and you've been on television so many times and every time that you and i want through the mall or gtarstang or somewhere here is one recognized but anybody in that ah and there from the young kids the six year old to be teenagers to the married a adults to to the older citizens and so an i i think that that's one of the main things that you have contributed is the relationship with the media which has not been built over a past year but over the past thirty five years and i think this one thing that you really contributed to the merry because an when we in the community a need to get a hole of some media courage oh who do we turn to to go mother well i thank you for the compliment but i think that dum behind every successful person man ooman ah that serves in order station or individually there has to be a people like yourself another supporters a imaritata one of a professor at the university that was able to aspachers conferences in and seminars ah through the leadership of of a ebenaceae in his tenanters ah but more so the people behind the scene that to the research the gadarenes ah so well when we go to a arguareche or beat through the media orotho he publican that we have our face together that we can talk about the tistics data and the disparities and the injustice particulars you know we've had some high profiles like what acomplish a veteran of the ornamenter he was so arrested at a bar a beduin in the bayou in a took the effort to allows to a try to get some degree of justice even though it was not satisfactory ah and other high profanas ah even from of the ladies were a young elisavetpolen year old that died was shaded by police after and that in the law suit that was for amby michael foliage under on behalf of the family a the city had to a come out with a letter apology and instituted many policies of a chain within the training of the police department that those cases don't happen automatically it it's a long range and chagrin process when the intestine any of these events or require all kinds of talent from legal to a ministration in everything and in a tingating that he has been a an your favor is you been able to will the different talents as you need i remember one case where we were having a problem and we needed an attorney's opinion and you said okaionlonhsera quick an so he codadad and that person was i able to come and help us and so i think that a big contribution being able to know as many people as you know and get their importation of like you if we need to have some other counselings you know a lot of people in the school district to you know the people that that run it and so you able to do this and this is good so i i like you to do may be here reminiscently bit about a a many people you have known here that have may be now passed away ay oh gosh it is too many booroolah for one just past a veteran or from a passibility sixty a tomtom yonge another rat trinobant of giafar and leaguers i could go and on to name so many that that were very temeniten rather in a benamor force and in a room organisations oblivion a untootered if with a dusante recentest dudines ah ah the chief of the southern district of a texas a federal judge ah he was very intent in the u llaves at linotypers texas which laclas oh er very wrong and it was a historical a case a landmark case for latinos because at a lolanders were able to prove that his peniworth entity ah and there were not quite and that was he before the brown wordsworthian i think what you portnasun a didelot of the ground were on that ah this was the argument was that at nondoing a on the murder of an individual but his crow was no live white noosance sir in insulters argument there went out a way to supreme court by some real fine allies one um oteseonteo and then the historiette and were given extreame by the veteran court on president unheard of a to show that his paniculata said the time had different water found tones like the the the blacks ah they were segregated in the schools in so there argumentator change for a latinism to day that ahumada ah being recognized in the wasmore um latinorum her his panic so now in the majority is for my nordausen it it's interesting to to ah other back and see that a lot of her organizations were formed in response to specific problems and undastood that was really there to a support the hispanic and so an oreseian came to be in fressher baconising forty eight i was founded by doctor gracia because there was a veteran there was refused burial in the cemetery because he was not quite in so at this i was the the one acterine the birth of american jewfirm an so and i i think i lack in in a baconian tween in also came into being because they were a lot of our misitions that were his pennicote were small and and and they wanted to have one large organization and so about the twenty three different or laces came in to to to a meeting in comerciante formed one ormston and it was called big benitiers is so hit happened then and they still have i now in the always worried casion project ah it is not too old but it came into in because we were not gethered seed to god although we have the like you said the leader now oh but it's important that if we would don't have the vote we really don't use are the potential power that we have a motor which is a mexican american legation which was also sponsored by rule a assalted tinkler districts have been various ramental in in representation and our right in the sense at a it was look back in history ah the younger generation that have not been exposed to discrimination and races have very little to go back in the history book particularly and textbooks of all the school districts and am in the state of texas and others i think that the fact that this recording a dish recording of history and i experience is is very un instrumental ah for um for the future generation because i think they let denotatively immigration being a matreona a people no different than the european trying to flee taxation and all that from europe to come to a america ah we we see economic disadvantages and seek an economic and freedom from other countries a preticly latimer and mexico and i think that he we need to be looking for comprehensive emigration reform ah and that's what manthing at lilac other or lusatians he definitely am i advocate a because we can talk about the success stories and we made but it we are shortsighted in our vision doesn't look for to future look at thee ah economic perch in power that we have the potential odorate tration the potential citizenship those lilac jafar alasian all these arniston than a arisest ent to day still a hundred years from now will be still trying to pave the road for full citizenship for litenin in america that is true and i and he has just listening to some of things a human involved in and the variety of things that you have done it in a touch on this also of tin lids me too to believe that we should be the really concern about the young people that are going to come to replace or to do things were doing now or maybe even more and better and hate wealth of ah of experiences as you have a need to be shared with other young people what we need to enter the younger people in an get them i too take over even now well john i i assabinus myself and the reader chaperoning front i think it a from the day said texas provocation in the number of people that you were able to play and that are very prominent a imprimaient or position in an off achetaient ah our tribe to your leadership and i think the other thing that my question is go on you and frank loco's vision of latin an inner oh what a made you motivated you to exert so many hours and time and money in gettin the latinamericans who are sad to day and your still on the board so on or you what motivated you and what is the ah what is your vision for the future on in that rintesano you you can't get involved in something like this for any kind of a monitor reward because there is none matifat his pen fomeone there in justice to send her going and oh but yes me on what motivates me going leveux mple oh we had these carcasses and and we were training people and ah they didn't necessarily have of any ah good work background and so we started really at a pretty a low point but ah we we were successful we had a good graceless in we would this good training and a given example of a foot motivates me o k i was at the city of houston a a a one of the apartments and then all of a sudden this this lady is young lady a was at me and said hello machineman hurry you doing so said i i'm going find how are you she said you may not remember me but i was one of your students so i said well yes i remember you how are you doing and she said fine she said i want you to something that ah before i came to logiotatos the classes i didn't have you near in our real job i had worked it was fast food and the most i remained was to thirty five an hour which was the minimum wage said that time and so a dentist but now i'm making ten dollars an hour i am doing really great in you all because of the chase i donoso i thought him a minute not thought well all the hard work that i've been doing everything in his panopeus this was just one person that that ah that i know about but we have trained something like may be two hundred people and so to help me in and to know that they have a stronger economic base now i have our inter community and so a nilemeter this family of outree people they went through our condition classes and they said though we're going to form our own company and her we're going to send our other two brothers into classes to so we can have a real strong company and so i thought the oneself these people are making a move less bonbennin the men their families and the committee the rest of their life so in these so that things that really kept captors going up like i said argerin the board so what is a vision for the latinaarians ah in the future well we will help to a continual re during and may be to better and bigger a thing we been the past we had sponsored to house and projects from one is a affected for a husband project in south houston and the one is about eighty nine a m the apartment in the east wood on these wines part of town and so these have affected the lives of a lot of people and this made we were the first to come base organization to sponsor house from project ah there was a hundred per cent of controlled by mexicanus and so ah and we both his meat with the hispaniola with the garotter and don torrefaction they reflected a spent community and for the future we hope to strengthen our skin we hope to increase are or affect on the house in market we have a god into the training and education of a people they want to buy houses because housheen such a a a man of field recently they heard a lot of people and with ill like educating the house in a respected customer is the best thing that we can do right now and we get in very involved in them have had a a success and a people are now by houses and and they know they know how to buy us because he had to be educated in a lotteries in order to do this now if the devaluation the house but the conception of the house and in the finance and involved in twentyone and things like that so this right now is the one thing that we are really concentrated on but ah we respond to the needs of the community when never a something an comes up to the communities we like to respond to that right ned's house and will respond to that i will also a still involved ucation and training and will continue that but it's something else comes of that we can do to help the community we will consider it i remember in a day a training that was a boy training that was done ah doctor togeather in a list in the vision of the agitation such as some potential we have not station ah in being able to right training of fother for a excess to be pencouet like through cable ah what other things said where are you in that and and what am in in conjunction with the community meetings at take place well who we will course tito to be an incubator for different ormistons after distorting out and we try to ah give them the on the opportunity ah i know that we have a in the past a menable to provide a place for organizations to start out that maybe didn't have the the finances to a payrent or the neediness tance and we provided that is much weak could a right now we have a the ah the lecge cases service enter that is a providing a scholarship information for our community and the been action for about twenty five years or so and uh they have been responsible for a getting our young people into the collins the they had done at least fifteen per cent of all his benighted in the antistates and so thin that a major of compliment and ah there was a time about in five years ago that they were having trouble being located in in where they were because ah there writ was going to go off and no the ah lenore want to a negotiate with them and so they were going to be a haven a tough time so we by the empty come to latinamericans they were tentative for as they did know how they fly work out but ah we didn't charge him in radforth first he lancinante finding god as situated and a note been there in their very happy and there the communities benefiting because they are there and the allotting people are getting good advice and get nesessite his scholarships and so we we we have always been of concern with the education of our people and the thebeginning now is to provide a scholarship assistance to tuscolee age people and to a provide educational resources to the people that are the verdure and so we hope to do that and oh we would like to have some kind of a skirling of assistance in getting into the media to like mentioned we would love to get involved in to a television for duction or a television or ah assistance to a to do our own programs ah this would be a good thing but financially which is not able to do that at this time i understand ed in conjunction you indeed the board has discussed the alliterative cademy and poorly a tell me what that means well you know oh where were also concerned with the ah the fated of lotor people do not have the necessary background to be to radiation in the community and in the leadership position and so this is something that we would like to at some point be able to provide a ewer nonprofit some uh positions in a menelean come in and a sister different areas that we have that we need help in it and and dust they they learn how to ah to work with the non propersition and the problems that we have it in their redans ration and ah this is something that i would like to explain it some point if we can get the you funding and in the background for this we certainly with would like to ahoein the big way oh we do have the oh support of different educators of the metoosin and a rise in the oratio santons and so i just a matter of getting a proposal on that is a funded and then weaken go with it i guess at the atonalities ah ha brought back memories and experiences so that we both shared and uh i think that for the future generation of leinster following not only our footsteps i have a stronger believe that a history is very important it we was no where we been in order to know where we're going up i know an old sand that is not acridly the way i say but if a ship captain does not know to what port he saying no when is favorable and i think that based on a pen of and what we live through the good the heart chipson and and the bad in regard to a intoleration in and motivation as well as persisted ah that's one lesson our future generation he unstand you can't give up now the true and i think what we need to hear in pasitheus that he not everybody can spend a lifetime like you i have in service to the community but even if you can spend one week at or one month whatever i give you community give back help them and a adomator bases don't don't don't try to to see what you can get out of it you will get satisfaction what you get some satisfaction or you will not hanto do anything else just do that and be happy
