other i think of now with current issues with our soldiers of postmasters is sorter sometimes i think maybe that was something heels experience but you know it was sort of something what many soldiers at that time don't talk about or they just would listen and and share experiences i guess and just moved on you know i'm just going to curious duty share this with your mom i think you were to the time that he your dad was gone well you know i have exposed some of the things and i am has a recollection of god being just being a husband and being a day and which he and she's right proud of that being a a person who who truantry cause she is involved in the daughters of america and um when just recently went uh the better stay came they attend the function that happened in the ridlets so you know it's that's something that that i can see them she and i talk about it she has shown me that pio she varying much in touch without son or do you feel like you are brothers sisters were looking toward all i guess looking it looking for i guess some kind of all oh i guess support from you when your dad was gone you know that's a port and i i have to tell you you know i do not give that much support cause i was also lost in itself you know in that same pain were all lost i mean i went through different in life that i have can at the say that was a that experience at a worbury hard on me and i would never want any one to go through that ah am like i i was i'm divorced but in the action happened sixty i amarre twenty one so was so quickly i got married that i entered in a an abusive marriage relationship you know my husband was more physically abusive tally beside but i think a an i think my mom noticed because i would go visit and he would never go with me when i will go in man to shaking all the time do pacing up a cup i would shake a amias n i was aware of it but i think she was became aware of it and then that's when maman her sister spoke with me in and in just mentioning a vid me to get out i shall get out you know and nothing was were the best words that ever that i heard you know and elopes thing i can do because you know i now saw mamma dad going through the busselton ship and i've seen no herd may be people stick to that relation of hoping it it changes may for some it does but you know i'm a thinkin it does for many so i think i got out just in time so homonoea alas marry for three years and um you know ah i have no regrets because then i went back to school that's what i wanted and i think he really want me to go continued my education do do you think that's your prodestants is is your avenging outbeatingest make that turn and he know she off the dirt mean and do something with my life you know just as something you know so i guess in an can come closer is how do you see a future now my future went as working and in the education fieldpines what kind of mister i don't know but i know that i'll be working with parentintins and commotion tiamat aim for the best worsteds just that's the idea but i i think of doing great your ah dunallan your down ministration and i think that's a that's wonderful way to go thank you very much at outmaneuver retinue of her you have some questions for you under one tales you'll have there okay you're looking so what do you think um what is what are your poison right now i i think i have dolosa education wise oh i think that lividly in his tinier one coming from a family who will did not believe in education and yet i felt like i was kind of on my on oh and always had to strive for better and i felt like i was in a lone man you had it he had to fight a battle yeadon um i was felt like i was a going for something that i i was very clear about until may be high school and so it was a long battle and am i i think that's the morose promised protista's probably graduated from college i bet there were the teachers and ministers out there who saw that potential in de eye now that i think that there was more am i think i think i saw it such a challenge that i felt that maybe some teachers did not think i was going to make it and i think that was the calling for me and for a that's why i think i'm an auction to day i think about though students who felt condole doubt of the system and i think that that that's what push me and but there were a few teachers on there and am i i think of at this why i'm in education that think on to make a difference and that that is my proseman's being able to get through the high school first of all and then next get through college and still trying to achieve i nieven up a wine that you have begun a course admistration too so i can see that you will your goal was home lemme ask im e trendle me refrain question so what is your goal now from a life i think my gold number one is to let my children i that am learning is on going and no matter what your age is a he should always keep striving and no matter what any one tells you you go for it and i i hope that that's what my children have got out of this and both of my my my children are in college now and my protest moment would be when they finish and they keep going further and they do their best and then i feel like i've done i've done my job i holender you said i you indeed was a a moment and his school that sort of strange the way your direction and canetella more am i think that there were some all there were teachers thereof that wore umguerte were they were in some way am it is yestate aching and when i saw the enthusiasm that the motivated me but also just efat that oh i i i the time i i been through so much with um trying to get to school not not having a meal in the morning a lungeing the only meal of the day so ill it was difficult but sonny's teachers came through for us to have any specific elamite so many i i think of a man each name is wilson am she's a great spanish teacher miss born she was she was a very very ingageth teaching education as she was she was a great teacher she was she loved all the students equally and that was teisey good oh there was oh a mister wells he was excellent science oh he was also very motivating and those teach surly reached me as it is make from poetery either estella i think about those teachers and what they did for me and i hope that i can wish just you know a couple of students that would be so great you know and that's that's what i think about i think about that something like parents weren't able to do for me because they know understand education but the teachers were able to do this for me and i ought wear it and i think it high school i have perfect attendants that didn't happen when i was in elementary ere i part in middle school so oh that carried me a long way too i feel like i was accomplishing things and that these teachers were there for me and that has really chased my light and i hope the stage my my kiss last then is the as been become am i beg oh i guess aspiration for them that momint give out and they need to keep going and no matter if some one says they can't do it they should a step back and said no i can't do this and i need to do this and any dediscere and that umtanum to carry them through because that had to be the fantoches things were not going as well as that light would like to have them to go through for me oh i think i was telling you pat about oh no sizter friends about those days when it was really cold and the therasaean don't you have a coach a war where should co tan at say wooning i'm not in that cold but i was cold and i was hungry but school was the safe place for me and to day i tell my students as you know i want this to be a safe place for you what do you teach now i teach fourth grade casaubon son this time that you feel like you really identified earthly goodness they are have been students said i that i i've done ified with and i and i think when i tell my story as i do tell my story we yearnit to pick the right moment for the story and am they are bee a few students that i think understand because i see a change in them and i see a change in their i guess the icebound looks like it more ivashin just disgust a little enough to i think that i think it's made a difference but unfortunately sometimes i wish i could reach more of the students but i think if i can just reach one or two and am desolves then then i've done i think i've done my job uh that averaged another delanda you know so i hope that the that i can do that and continued doing that and that i can all make a difference in their lives and it one day at all say i remember that forth great teacher i don't like it i remember those teachers of a life tell me about going a college what was to minesota difficult i was i would he niversity of heston and all that was that was that was very difficult for me it took me a waldric's i also had long challenges while i was there my um by dad got really ill duratite my mother my mother was ill my brother was ill swanlet of things going on and i had to wardrop out for her body year and a half in ankle back all but oh like i said i i didn't give out and oh i guess i guess when i look back at it i wish i would agradates sooner oh but i do take me a long time it home while i i to work full time to homeport my parents and am but i find it not a donatistic day as graduations i had i had got married i ad married maybe a few years and am gosh i rememering that it ah is that all there is and i remember singhalut was a very good feeling i was so happy to wit those imaged feeling whereat the rontgen my parents ah my dad was already am madeary died and am my mother was there i think finally she got it that education was important at she neighboreth because she thought about the food and you know ruffhead and am i think if that moment oh you know she understood she understood i think she was happy for us she happy for me and my husband was extremely happy because he knew that this is something that i wanted and then i follow fanlighted sobattere uctoris andconcentrated in most of your last and yes wonder if you have yet he moment in it like final words or versificata you have to people in arsenicum from similar backgrounds that don't give up no matter what you come you'll come across an obstacle work through it contind it cried find way she be can work through it over it under it find a way you know with their swell this way you might have all these ah montressor words at me sound kind of corny but believe me so times that gets you throw it because if you have no one else to support you as only you yourself you talk about i think about a just you breathe body strike the leaving about and while you eat while you see what a show you think about just push yourself no matter what you go through it say something feel on the imites okay i i i think that no matter how hard or or how you feel when you feel him down you really need to um i guess challenge yourself and say yourself i i can do this i will do this and in no happener you yeah i agree with you and thank you for coming over you love then you bet being
