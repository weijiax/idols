um look up to our parents in glad that you had those great remodels in your life unfortunately we have so many youth through the hot who can't answer yes to those ah remodels what do you feel that a up into a has been the high light of your life the high lighter alive have think was when i got my gal my michael i got him when he was nine months and i always wanted to have a boy a good heaven more children so my who is michael michael is my adopted son for he was a top and then my second husband a fell like this is stuff or time that i actually fell in love when i met frank in a house good and all that but he was very possessive another high light was when a graduated from the lawn forcement class i got a standing ovation from all the guy case was mostly guise in they were like only five girls and and the rest were all being and for me to get us that an ovation for a there minos really something and i also a less your when i want a national office the aluinnen oh so you've mentioned little a caftan how how how many years have you been involved with lilac i have been involvular years and a head position on the local level the state level and now at the national level how do you see the lack at really assistant to his paniculata has an over all well or all i am i believe in the philosophy philosophy of lulala easilie organization promoting education in erything so ummoned been in existent eighty years so uiverunna go but i believe the true diehards that really believe in like us they on forever as members because we want to do the work helotes i like has actually come along way to as you indicated early where you were one of the feemale ah graduates the same with lilac when it first began it was just mallorean such a day we have elias officer of the po the south west so that has really come along way within its eighty years of of ten year exactly okay well let's go back in arrear remanebit your childhood what do you think your childhood was like my cell had was real good i had a son i had i felt lucky because i had both parents i had a big family at an extended family my aunt was across the street she would come over every day i had a grandma grandpa so am madaras very strict or he was for metaconet old a mentality from midyears or girls and they stay in sight the learned how to cloathe can't go outside and play with her brothers and then the top at all my brothers were like my guards because a after school they walked if on the boshology they will walk in a church a corcobado and that some of the thing you know but i owner'll i had a good tochello well protected but you feel that my half hour something in your life that had been devastated in our something that which is become in mind of maybe up possible nightmare something that you just a something that happened within your lifetime well the first one of tinwaldkirk my gold my son ah in whinniard him to his real mother and do without my permission and michael came back and told me ma'am yes what am i made my real man to day and i was so upset and michael was kind o tremiti for a couple of weeks concise would ask me when i ah how is it that you got me in all these monthous and questions at the kids want to answer but um ah what all i told my god that he was special because i got him i got to pick him and a asoenius ly he was some part of the family that my brother had father him and at um that he was actually a related but that i've always wanted have a boy and i couldn't have any more children so he was like a blessing planasia blessing that i got in he turned out to be one of the best when i was a great opportunity has an aunt in he set up to the play to actually be his mam aright another thing there was very devastating to me up to this date and it kind of hurts to talk about it but that was my daughter train because the way we were raised the midst in way not to his bantingite emensely would be a principle that my paris brought from meg that family is everything in entrainante husband oh they came and dropped off the kids when night what are unjust come back from a convention and they dogged all four kids and they didn't come back when he he dropped them all to father and said he and i'd help a training left me palala and i need help and lord in behold i didn't know he was not coming back and they made me very angry and very ah absent with her that she would do something like this while sousseyou have four grand children that would just drop up to force steps what were their age is at this time you know was five and could not speak ordericus and thomas was eight and jessica was nine so it was like you haven't a start all over again to raise your grandkids as so they stayed with you up until this day you raised them all of yesapan this day and as to have to eat live jessica and arcades good just graduated from college and just go a be graduating in the simbri think it's that the spirit that your parents may have in stillington not everybody would have been able to say wait the minute a want of my supposed to do you opened your arms and i hueten ed it to your family and that god gave you the will and the strength to carry on side think you have been blessed it was just like for some reason they were left at your door steps knowing that there were going to be in your hands and till they were able to succeed on their own so applaud that as such a awesome story there was a favorite temeritate the first month in a a in this happened like the run julie because i just come back from the convention and um been michael kipiatilnik winnowing that leadest ay with us why so he had to make an adjustment there and the key has had very bad little habits you know we used to go to the store and the two little ones were thrown himself on the four because i would not buy them candy and they would tell me when we get home said grandma here not the saying nice gravel we used to do i not said of course not because now her parent and before that i was just pickup on week in this take you to the movies take you out to eat and then take you back but now i'm your parent things have changed and their rule to follow so were all going to have candy in this house may be three times a year and we don't eat all the house you sit at the table when you eat and there's other rules that you can have to follow on and that was hard you know that was very hard but it had to be done because they had some bad little habits they didn't know how to do a lot of stuff for themselves and am i i had to start from scratch you know if they came without clothes without furnture without anything and then three months later after that at one of the girls told me in her considerin i said they actually planned this not at what she said you grandmother was across the street all the time at grandissima dad came in and dropped us off now that really infuriated me and i went to see a lawyer and demand ten omar that i got persisted partment well first they gave me permanent custody un up and cold you know weeton eck and court date let's seems like it was all an off or the mass and that the those children really a benefit it most from you raising them that a soule's going to a little bit more about you know what do you feel you've missed out you know you were a second man for so many years so what are you fiumare missed out on our ah may have liked with in your lifetime well my parents were good parents but of for some reason patino a lot of a motion a lot of affection my mom i could tell you now let they get leading commodate you i love you or things like that that they are you know antiquated style in my dead i the only time he made a like licorice when he would just play with my hair like old saturdays when he had a couple of metres or something he was in a good mood at mamma could tell by the way she called my hair every day she made braids and ah and she dressed me up with her with my home made clothes and ah i she said me a you look so pretty and i could tell you an she would take pride and in getting me all pretty duffer school and and i well i felt that affection there but as for as hugs and kisses you know that was not then done in the household you know and then there was harder for me to him i notions rate that i had to learn that on my own that dino a work in with a kid said juan alyona all reading all the psychological ennatha griper ence really help me o express you no love in an affection munatoris ma grandkids when i got him while leviore able to out reverse that rollingmills affection to the grand kids and as long as i'm on you you've always been a love and care in person so i think i may be that like of affection may do even a stronger but a person that you aren't to day so what do you think it was grown up with the at the limited all income or the limited at places so you had growing up will actually we had a good ulietea you know my my grandkids will grandmotherhood whitecoat and isidora was tight with money ah said he made that house we always had three meals we always had close to where we did move from house to house i said to me that constitutes us they will family in my dad had a job with a railroad he made good money mama never had to go out of the house and work so he provided for us and we had a three good meals he always had grossetete did without anything you know so i considered myself pretty lucky having that that's truly a blessing in that a sense because yes i think to day generation kids fell that they need anything and everything that comes out on the market and they just don't realize how am fortunate reuben what do you think some of the principles that you have and steeled and if carried on through your life may have passed on to a grandkids o my dead like a sail was a very strong person oh he had this stone carrater body aoyama that about him like i used to go to the bakery across the church in the said he or you a pet but the as daughter as it why and this at all you look like him because your facial expression or something like that you look just like your dad and i go like human um myntgatan well it was not a good good thing but a kind of a a strong characteristic that he always because he always made was always the togeather in the neighborhood we were considered the good the shoes girls cause we would never am have any contact with any mosestein or the grocery store somebody would look as my dad that he what you look in it and that kind of serbonian that kind of stuff and my mam she loved music as soon as my father would go to work an that's where i really learnt to appreciate music we always had music in the house during the time he was not there beautiful music she would sing she would dance with us and i think i brought that on to my grand kids to positive music they love to day and and oh we always danced together at parties and stuff and am you always try to tell the kids oh you know cause they felt bad when they they the parents are left them and night took him to counseling and stuff in the keasberry why and i tell him this is why because you have strong parents like the one i had and then you have a weak parents like the ones you're paterans were weak parents us said because and this is what happens when you marry early would you marry young you start to having children and then you get baldwin you feel like you can't handle it or you don't want the responsibility and this is why i want to consider when you grow up not to have children until you ready because children are vigorous possibility so that's one of things we always shared together in an hour calopogon and thanksgiving and christmas they would always get kind o not teritet to set already like this we will like to have our whole family as i know but you have to or be grateful for what you have you know with him go back and then and fix the pass as it may be one of these days herforth or your mother will come round and you know of when they're old i unitarian for you well i can surely attest as silas love of music so he can be it on the dance floor all night long no matter where we go we don't even need a partner sylvia would dance in a kittery going and said seacome on on on the foreign and joined me and we have danced to the wee hours of the morning that i can surely or enjoy in it it is one of silvia's legacies so how would you want to measure up or what be must remember for over a mounted sylvia well when i am got the second job as the constable landforce man officer i saw a lot of them a besotted you know a lot of these especially the men that bagusu their head and they think they're gone wan in the innominato else there so when i was a constable i stopped a lot of the abuse especially when i had a a rank you know sergeant and captain of the nun reserves to work with a lot of the guisards and stuff especially those men can roldan stuff in a salaams and a couple of times i had to confront him as it hey i want you to leave right now before i called the office and have some one pick you up you just by late that persons have a right he enhances on his knees you have no business heading him so i want you to leave right now so i turn right around and ah uncomforted personal for you hear what some one this ayesher with my brother so called a brother nasalia him on this is the number of the office this is the officer that he had him if you want to go falashas on him go ahead and do that to morrow i have to make a report so my report will be there and your name will be on their so except you and thanks like that i saw a lot of abuse happening on a specially call out of abuse towards women all on these clubs a in the guise yooooooo is because he guisthorpe give that one to sylvia any kind of domestic abuse that would give him to me ah because a lot of these men wertherean the girl friends or their wives had that look at somebody or somebody accidentally came and asked him to dance in the husband wasn't there you know it's not their fault and i one time i confronted this guy ragusa to get up on his face and i set okay you feel so tough y when had woman go ahead and hit me and you hear uniform with her guns and all i aright and he is he just walked up to me like he was going to hit me but he stopped back i said you just a wee as said i we you don't understand that my wife now said i don't care she's not your parbury toushines your wages opposed to respect her and another time another la grosse was only like seventeen eighteen and she says my boy fewer on and get married as it is said girl if he beat you up now who you think he's going to do when siteration home with him i said he's going down town for beating up and i'm nothing to press charges i said i don't care he still carapresa charges on him for beating too we had witnesses and a moncayo debt no no place them combination girl i'm doing your favorance so the day was very appreciative that i called him a cup of a time when i used to work at talked of christmas you know bunch of white kids come in for for college days and and they wind up by dancing on the tables and throw a walk among other stuff like that cause so know we will work to for a line in the morning and ah and there was this guy in a man he was severely severely drug so he passed out on one of the patio tables and i i went and got his idea and i saw that he was a student at some mark was university so am i asked one of the guides said ah which one of you know knows of matthew here and he said i do not said don can you take him home he said yes he said can assanow he came here his carkis he's got to come to morrow and talked to me and get his carkiss cars going to stay here all night and i'm on a trusted you i'll take him home i'm going to call you in an hour and in measure that your home while the father came to next day and um and ah he said me an my relief on a atink you for doing that for my son he herleva i'm sorry he got out of hand i said well i figured that that he was a student and headier cord of toward being drunk in public so i decided you not took the liberty and then in hashirakake him home he said well you don't know how much appreciate that because you know my son would have had that on his record nessita things like that little things like that that eden if i felt like i could help without them being a danger out on the street i would do it so amazonites offish with you that i eat think what then your life history of a long forcement you probably have a thousand and one stories to share with us like that and i only then is a probation of sir like gum i had some kids when i first started work in it probation we used to use voice town and braska so lorimer five months ago i got a call from one of the kids and ah these worad the whole family right there from my plain homes on ronald stream that i was naberhood regnier i used to have like ten tenaya for men are so these kids some i said him too a sinton because he had broken a broken helagu the other three just wanted to go out there because i esteem was to inroads i managed to get him a free scholarship out there and to them or a practising attorney now and am in a breast other two came home to texas and i got two there police oficers on an austin texas and the ten waterport police in a very now and then or run into some of them and a misregarded off there in the filth out even realizing it sonitui people come back twenty and thirty years later saint must come all is he really put my i put my life in order for me so that is a great accomplishment always feel like helping or now that are retired us ben a lot of time or volunteer and because i enjoy that you know of course i enjoy being at home too but you know i like to go on in and help us many ropes i can what was it like being a woman in landforce when you first got into it how i war of stories do have a woman do it was tough because indeed a constable's office for a was there was predominantly men he was like eighty per cent men twenty per cent women and then um this new constable to govern em when he took over i was already a sergeant so everybody had to start like from scratch there was a position open for a little turned and applied for an itigailit so then ah one day he comes over he said i you know why it an't get the literation i said no he said as i want you to be my camp the nisida he said you want you to be the cap the null the one none reserves i said great so when i became papeite to in a lot of different stuff i started to an inspection on uniform and there a deminution i would do evaluations i would brought with them on annotators a specially whom we would hit the the warrants the criminal warrants will be her executioner to a got there and they were very a machine i had one there was always a not so much harassing me but sexual harassment at aliened is a man like me boboland take his billful out the big water money and am one night he went in so far as to follow me to my apartment and a lourdement door no said what do you want he awaithin have a chat nessita my boyfriend coming in a minute you better leave or a one call the precinct to beg you up and i also when i became captain they started calling me on this man that was upset that i got the position start calling me clean be nanawit the sting and in so gaiatare changing things that ain't like that and at any time they came dirty or are begitatiha home and ah i would do we would do a lot of community service and am i would have rollcall in mister that wertherlike and things like that so we started to inelastic in the neighborhood but a lot of them got to know me after that cause they kind o resented being bossed by female that was one other things ah had towardliness rejected to um and ah i had to refer to the constable the constable dolobelle in your bed and leave because she is the captain and if you don't like the way things are done here you can leave so i have to support from the constable from the beginning so but allow these officers you know took him a while to turn round in and end up be supervisor a female studiano you intull earned the respect which was a great fret for i year a stature has been that female officer in romolo other females some department could look up and say a law she has a title of captain and there is a hope climbing the that letter that is also well i want to rematerialization and did it great accomplishment with them with a grand kids what were they act to day will jinoon her own she got married his baby thomas is am i had some slips and some falls and a because he felt like he was a boy he could just do anything in us in no time as everybody has to follow rosier and a couple of times i had to throw him a littery throat house ask him to leave because he would come in to thretening sometimes it toxicated an i said i don't drink in this house and not nogoinabe anybody drink come in he to my house durioin follow the rules you can have to leave it hurts me thomas but you could not have to follow the roses so now he he tells me said gramaticali that because you know i learned my lesson i learned the heart way and he did you know he had some stumbling so ah and ah fell hard but you know he picked up the pieces and hastened right now a really proud of him and arianus oh jessica is taken for ever but she finally going to graduate consenses ben going part time all the time and arcos going full time but i just go finish in december and arcarea got her degree on the deadened that is acomplishment in itself congratulations i am thaletis of wonderful um story to have the say that you know you had to be a mother with your own children and then start over with a grand kids anchors them graduate not only high school but from college i mean one of lesseneth when they left them on your door steps who would come this far another a thing that early or what was a big impact to my mother helped me a lot and am therefore while she got real sick when she ah had cancer and uh well were in the hospital and of the doctor told her that there was nothing else that could be done and ah she said me how can i go home to live with you and i said of course you can mamacita because i have taken out to career but fifteen years before they went she broke her hip by to a tree my house and took care of her so ah in an tigert my house and i made like a hospital room in my bedroom and had a bed for her and the kids would sing to her they would play instruments cause i made a made sure that all of them played instrument and they would camerara thing to every day so she had a peaceful death at at my house and dump that was one of the hardest things because the day she died the kids took it very very hard especially when the hurst came and ah and ought thought i was going to crack a but i had to be strong for them and it was an until that night that i was able to coelestin and cry for a could do that if feather i'm sure it's hard for any that analyst he exposed the grandkids to grandma and great ramon that they have that bond and we them so that they'll never forget that it hopefully carry that on in generations to come well so be i think it's been a great time havendo tell us a little bit of your history or story major
