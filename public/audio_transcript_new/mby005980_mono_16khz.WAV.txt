nine year so to day is november the twentieth to those a nine and there i am here with my grand daughter edith for a foray okay i am i really superexcited to be her grandma and i guess to begin with i just wanted to an thank you for coming here with me to day and am i ontague explain why i decided to come here with you because actually i could have come here where annybody but you were the first person in my mind in my poseetion of the reasons i wanted to bring you is because you are like the matriarchal ar pamily and i think that you have lived a long life in his fine rich with experience in history and am now that i have milly who is only four and unhappy that she has it the chance spend time with you and to get to know you by like a said she's only four and i think that getting something um tangible having something tangible something that recorded to share with her later on when she's able to her and then she can on and i guess not just lily but i think about all of your grand children and all of your great grand children lily is like totally fortunate because she am pationate to spend time with you i think that you have a lot of other even your own children children and grand children and great grand children that don't have the opportunity to spend time with you and am so i guess one of the reasons i wanted to do this with you grammarism to have something tangible to share with our family members and am i think that further on down the road whether it be you know ten years twenty years we can still look back on this and listen to your voice and and you know some in some way find a connection with you even though i italy foleated to your right now but i know that there are other family members to down have that opportunity so that's one of the reasons i want to to do that donoso reach i have reshaped by a bonito for me to i am very happy jubilo to you in his specialite forth generaters which'll because not that she old enough to remember me

intrude all to migrate daughters camilla angela and then my son grant children terry had her junior and michel little ramon as we call him but of course he agramant to rent or much children my own children that i rely loved the lithe dearly and hope that nakaniella for love still here because that's what keeps me going yeah am i an another thing to me my one it does the reason to do this i

my parents say don't make no de age made no difference what they commended as a bay so late little different and it is now a day pose am nothing or caraway smoking drinking all of that but we often

growing up way by an buttonhole you are worn on intent on what day joined the first anecdote first an identity i young that was all soul during the depression second remoras getting started and things were getting protestare and pretty frightful of course they show i didn't realize nothing but i felt to everything that was going on you are the oldest of human kids i am the second child of thirteen children but my mother had we my parents did their best to bring a sop because i am very broom because even though they did no education they did her best to hope but you and see that on because i

gasfitters to a sentiment and to antonio say conto now when you were going up cramoisie you grew up in spanish was our primary language originaires my parents don't learn english and the sea was the first shiloni was not surrounded by the two manichean that new easier but the baseness little the business is there were there some people they speak english and every time they were trying to do the best to get this man children cullen ailings before they started for trade school so that they could better themselves he would not have to suffer but not onderstand in what was this scusin school did you have disabled english was in school english was first a plain wishing in my mother had bravely said i do next door neighbor who was a teacher herself but then she was a technicalist only a case did not as but mamma saw that it was essential for me to leontine is said of just betideth even though i might not be school age but she wonderful me to learn something did you am why why you were in school an did you enjoy your being at school did you enjoy and in he knew or was it a hardship whim i can not say what a heart she pontoneers but i had but time sarthiano i had to help my mother home and she had thirteen children for i was not there for the very last one but but they didn't all survive it they all thirteen head taxation altered to an almost six of us arrived we were three boys enter girls and the other one died in inconsistency be there a france course may be like omenica lactation who knows i don't know and as to say i know all i can say is that matters in the best with what they knew with what they had and with what was available as because of course but had the money there in not going to help you as much as if you could pay for him there was an allowed give her just outside of this warm about your family life and the hardships that you endured and having to go to work at early age and am in no descrying to survive basically me that can you remember any of your home any rule happy moments of your childhood you have any memories like that oh i have a lot of happy memories ben acholoe and a little thing i enjoy you you don't have nothing else or i viewed or no nothing else would it that way like we did him a bunch of new toys we did have we had to do our own during christmas was a very happy time for my brother felix who was born after me because my daddy used to take us out to them of a sidewalk and there was brush and he would call a lie of the tree will bring it home put it in at bucketful of dirt and then of instruction paper we would make shanto hang a stream in on that little bridge we work were looking forward on the time for people to come by and look at what wakemanites my mother would say all the little empty to made a pace can and we would adiposing to eating it on us as the christmas decoration and of course you know we got a little something for senecas but it was something henry that my mother made me recall my other baby at a picardian editio string the abbate good pole the tolomei graniani i remember grandma had seen the pretty good but am i i she because she didn't speak english there was that language barrier but i knew you like i could sense going up that she was just a gentle sweet lord she mercenage never went brain she seemed to be at his side on the theme and maybe that's what gave me the station gave me this feeling of one thing that i can not afford i am on my satisfait doing my best but i it will have to be manasarowar even get started in a antinomies totally about grandma it seemed that she was such a giving woman and even though a did not have a light she was always wanting to share the things that she did have with her friends or with your navvies just one play of free cheladet up and to take some to the neighbor or whatever he might be your an then a god on so you're in the holidays christmas especially may be thinks dividing bors for just like a big time they would get stuff rus and we would chair whatever we had a iron with them my mother would make the molished take this to oneadatote they thomery tell him that this is so come in from the bottom tomarite behappened or when he was inciting wedding have not curtis we did had nothing finetta but whatever there was i saw sherbelloff us and on miatovich say a prayer he someway in his son manner but if he won edition on ice wittington that i can see that even to day we might think when we celebrate christmas an it's not so much about the big gives are the material things even i know i my man does is to show give little gifts but really with much more thought and love behind each gift of whatever she gives you know she is a preciation appreciate think that sometimes other people look oneself you know they don't understand like i like got a pair socks for christmas i know it is like me the better we they expect something meg for i know and i and i can think grandma has seen that in you for that kind of expression of love through just the small things and so that's that makes all of makes it so much nice nicer you know you manoofer manytimes nine i feel like giving somebody a gift with all my heart so what i do is i can either so it kelilah or get some mature and so some philotaes or just a lie scar for the entire which has no mean and to nobody but the gibe me because i know i said but time aside i said at the material for a purpose and it was always spring to god but they would n't prachadee now that you mention it grandma and let's talk about your hobbies which is i know that you enjoy a sowing and you've made quilting you do going to and em is that because you grew up where you did a lot of sewing or dis diou start doing these homes and your i had to learn how to show a cause i was the oldest girl of the family when marsanne lester and dora began to one little girl ittle grasses my mother would tell me i'm going to buy pesatura and you are going to sit down and saw them in the dress i tregarthen mine so and dress when not only know capocate pattern so what i would do i would on to an no dress that they no longer wanted to wear or that was already just for state home where precedent and used it as a paper and many times they appreciate every sin they scottie don't in olaneta funny because as i actually don't know how to sew noctural done that night knowing that you should be started doing like that metallically made never otherwhere waternomee i did know whar to go on and have the winter to go by the patriot in a money that my attentaeter expensive nowadays so only now you know i i feel like i was a very important person with folliculaire for the important my mother was busy so i to what are you most proud of grandma when you think about your life and all that you've been through can you can you think of whom this is conahar question you but i do but you know it's simply a an i sits a computed number one is that i want to think at first for a man blessing for having given me so much life and yet i'm still up and about and cantackerous for having such understanding parents who even though were not educated they always wrote to us that we were very onto him and that whatever that could duffus they would do a number three that after i became a woman and realize and became a mother i have six children of a son i just followed the parent my mother said for me i'm weel probably didn't have nothing special to provide for them but there was one way leolom when never much on cry i was cry along with them because i knew that there was a race i espositione that we were thought that is a family you stayed to hear you just a wonder of or forget because there will be a tory when we will one together again so your paintresses and then his will we alewife we have lived before we came to get so am the family values that the ring us proof your proof the family values a turcaret said was still depones guess i am any way grandma hecate so what i wanted to now it is asked for some words of wisdom sometimes i think that sounds so tritanius true i think that even your life experience as you do have just a wealth of knowledge and wisdom that you can share with us and so i'm going to pray would like suds give you topic in the new whatever you learned in life what would be some advice you might give to your children or their children it for generations to come apaiser in education will first of all to me tell you m to like totally impressed with the fact that you did get educated beyond high school after you had your children and i can remember as a child over in your house on and senioren corpus im we'd be running around the house in you would be getting ready for and you would go to work at the constitutents and amatinchan anything if it then and that reminds me of now how lily is the oiaesis and just you know awhile back should not rekintation my mom would be dinnered for lukanians it's it is kind of a generational thingis i mean is so imaging to me they after her children were grown and that you went back to school that you gueredon and i mean to you got an education beyond his school and that even in nursing you know it's so like wild it's a pint at a mazing so regarding education what would you say to know your ire wood to anger family members and during the earth for education to my own children i would advise them to is still it into their children that without education there going to feel lonely at times because they will never rash a day gold that they have been there without gettin educated first and to my greater and children which would be your children i in my own words whichever way i could get it to them i would start reading to them and some to repeat after me and later on explained to them why i did it not because i wanted to hear them repeat what i had read to them but because i was hoping he and wishing that they would learn if it only made one word there will learn it and learn that that word was going to be repeated in their life and that they had to know what it meant and that they had to face it themselves because their consituted would be a dog and that the time you look back i think your parents your grandfather and palusami ly for all the encouragement they gave you while you were a toddler what you yourself don't know what was ahead for you to face turner a dollie okay what about regarding relationships say family relationships were would you say to your weinerisch lessons came from a knitted family you know oh did you i what a needy family gay and i diddikai and nittai effacious i think one that they should be that close to to their own family because there is a time when you live the parents you might move away but keeping concheteter that what you left behind the butter will replace even your sister your brother whom you used to find with him you would sholemnly is friend lines when they are not noticed a you when no olivain to wait the amonober the youse do you er you will long so evening else i wouldn't stay in to my grandchildren at never never to part to where they no longer carbottle is what life is salathul you say to am at the females in her family about the responsibilities of being a wife i can neapel since i had to girls only and the majordomo children were wise for boys there were days when i had problems with ingirds because they seemed to know it all they one atoopa in our dthings that we are sevestre would not let them do because we were afraid that not by your talking about my momentino at the present tibaeul not be hurt but my way etaoin later on in life they might get hurt and that they were mercenaries spirits because the girls saw the one that a riskin ban a merrylad at night not bled in your parents know the truth what is happened unto you because i terentilius trust should be your eager your mother i know it is hard to do my dear father understand because even maountin when my husband would get after them but that is onright that will then filbertines day when they came to me i would always say in this is on to be a lesson that you warnham to put a santander and become a man like you netty you face something like this so that's why we're trying to tell you don't do that that is sure in eurite in my withering to do at that time and at that moment but we have lived longer than you and we love you and we are trying to prevent you from going to that hard hardship many we don't want for our children you know am to suffer because we know what it is already to suffer so we went to eliminate that at of their life it sounds like in terms of like being a wife that may be which our saying is that you and your husband should be on the same page regarding yes yes i behold were they to be done if i tell ye my children or you are not wanted and then they run to the father and and he says yes you can go i mean they get confusion lay on to rain the next time do you know they got to raise the person for stansmore congou if you talk things before like a husband used to say you know the lay o a the left come to you and talk to you a bad one in to go to this day were they said that they will come to you because old in that they will not hold or if they were going the better be home a certain hour and they seem not to like that well we're not asking them if they were to to be a tonnawanta not as in them to go digito go and don in joy yourself we are only telling them you may go but there is a certain artemus return home with limoilou say ethel okay when last question before you at things at rameishwer want to be remembered when all is said in how you want people to look back and upon you and say oh we will what how exactly do you want to be remembered wherein i have always been a very simple person i don't uh one do to cosmopolitan or cusinier to much eleanor i say when you want have to do remember me this way that way and i just want to be in their minds of the time whether on still here or whether a imbodiment for them to remember me for the good time that we had together not only the batiment they found like i was not a good mother to damn the case i deny them to do something that i knew was on her to and do the my friends the people i know i was one in hope that the remember me like i was a carryin person i was a person who did what a cold if i was as for help and to me life was a most isamisi thing i would try to help anybody who is needed and time if i came and i i you can rest to share that i truly know that and i believe that an i preciate that yet were you know like i say mehadia harebrained in some of these ah the mother manytimes in no suffocates they become adolescens they sang they know it all that they unnoteworthy want to do because that in bensersiel when forbidden them to do such a train is this is my life yes this is your life but i am old ely your i have gone too altamore than you realize and the isanusi here is because one afanasiitch a tried to better it in ex time from man from doing from the rapidan of whatever relather me but you know he just said that this is my life that i think that that's maybe this is a good way to end because he really is our life and we share our lives yet yawningly our family members and to hoso allies a rinform is his theban then and everything we do has an effect on intinsion us on the family so it so we can believe this is my life but really this is our lives really but do now where pony have a bunch of voice and they densities say just a thing acosto their head but you with a parental understand that it's pecause the man with a hay they delight the answer you gave them well that all right i'm going to be the mother for ever and then going to be my child for ever so there will come a day for in you not think will be okay for the whole emanation the stollen ed there that thinks a grandmaster i felt right i make myself understand oh yes that was a good
