i as the kids some toomy am i just remember a lot of people being in the house and i remember then being in the house and i think it was the time that they took that one picture that marriaging has on a anadesme muteshin it that stands out to me as i remember great gramont tallest person in the room i mean i know every one is tall and williston to to a you know five six seven year old but i remember him being taller than the adults in the rogron yes i e that is the thing that stood out to me that he was a very tall man a great granma was tiny tulips in comparison yet she was the smaller she was a small fatima and she wore a head scarf type thing or at amember she wore it all the time but i just remember she had it on that day and i don't remember why we were all at the house and on merit was some short holiday or after something to cific ere i not i have very very few memories of them and then when i asked tad recently i mean i remember only thing i remember about the masafuera

side and i on my moslemah like families i mean be on onthemaker no no no as i remember i remember not even that long ago finding out that cathy was only our half hand now that the elder you now that i remember it not finding that out until we were like i was probably seventeen that both grandpa and grandma opus had this was to act marriage that they had been married before and talk about different boy go now for that time period above getting wasn't but for us and it was it i mean it not like nowadays it was because of a divorce it was that both of their they had married young the first time and both of the other souls had passed away and that we had grumbled at least one child from that marriage and grow will had cassie i was like who she's only my human would he not you boleye that it

joshua he says your dad or dabit she actually meant larry will edermine ah god i think the most i remember that house on heat in the most yet i guess i'm just beneven after gumapas away the living marentel am to lie till to sattan e was in it no no belan night in waust too far benasco so big as both houses were must at best the one inquiry in the one and teetotaler was there more she was in the other of the larry was living on the hat romalis yes gramadewata in the house on commentary was living here i can on member what you are that as i won a satiety seven or ninety eight and obiit was ninety eight bessage was gone and i remember larsan on god she sensitiveness to it because the house was basically destroyed the barely standing on when we went that that's what it was when we got happen out tober because we went for thanksgiving that year it was in the house there are no yes because we saw just the frame work for the house on the veteran he chase we were trying to walk through it and it was just like it most i gone on you and in the house one in good toronto i was still standing in the ills yet i now wish to tea it was just i could probably could not have been repaired even if they had wanted to know but the house on common is it the i think i remember the most like i guess because we lived there for a period time often on from the time we were probably six to twelve or thirteen o my nets one i'm thinking he made younger because we were vitoria we were in pasadena as what i remember and then we moved back to victoria and that when love back to heston as he gave ember changing schools aitkin i mean i remember going to i think a school for each grade and to porkington for me be adamastor e two for second grade yes and i think the first school we were only there for like a week a couple of weeks we ones is relative bayaya that house and grammontoises just some it's not exactly a memory in the something that was always there when you has cried gonoff ice if she likes him busily um she had very way way ranghar sooner m m darkish black black and white not like our arshtishena color oh tis little taller tiebout your height i think be so she was torn atentive five maybe in two small size about ye to it she was definer and she got sinner well as as as i she got on her ashy got older and was thus yes they were really off yo when she spoke always spoken battishall now she knew this in the doing he anyting gosh most thought yes but i think she knew morning wish because of as and even yet marian he is i went to school yet even as cessanta could she was the youngest and she was last one in the house and so he probably there was like they grew up being spanish and were of that generation were arm parents they grew up speaking spanish and then that when they went to school they were punished reporting spanish said aniantissement most i mean that's just the day agentin yet thinking that it was something you weren't supposed to know on the order of to speaking spices beginning a musher first language and the side benefit of the children not understanding the conversing there was that for them we aumale personality seemed like she was important figure in your life perimeter on i think yes when you are a little iron is every one is stricter but i think i still feel the way in that we were her favorites yet no haltestelle even if she told someone else had one on a casion she sighed gioire she's i and i think it's more because we were just degree you know i don't remember anna or elsa and the rest of them coming to see her as much as we did or lie didn't live with her likely day he didn't live with her tea i mean we were just always there how monteriano was close i guess really clifford she was close they had a good relationship and that they talked about everything in then when when she was sick that or she had a thin as culpatory that summer i rothiere from june to we went back to school in august elspeth the summer there are we just spent the summer sir but it is as a herauld go visit for you now we were living in houston and we would go visit for you know a long weekend or something and crying because i didn't want i didn't want to go back home or it's cold you're going to weave a argentiere stay here for the week end of the outlawed basically the sin so they be the stay for the week and they'd have to come back and get us to next week i am speaking a food she must yes tis the unity tried under shows had made her tears and innerly take with me but the deemer who bought his through it all beloiseau i i emerson o o you that but my themes she was sowing his hat of make them so summation remember if it was uncle be or hector who went imbortant were little his we were young we were like under tension i remembered thine to evidently the what the lard one note can of lard a big plastic thinking or talking a little plastic but then like the abatement was the flower said palmetas flower a woodhouse green or yellow stove in the corner then a hat she had the long aplatado that you maronnier i think angry noon i remember watching her and her fighter and i tried marchesi can't fit them with my fingers like she is to i have to do some opacity better night something as she chose to just foot on with her fingers and to she just knew when to do and to titan my other favorite thing was the pecamane o you an she didn't i don't know she is delight to make it over was too much trouble ballinagrub like that but she used to tell us if you wanted it and we had to shell the pea or in a tether were pecan trees around the homes that we had to go pick up to the cannon shell if we onehood make it may be a man then for wimille there on the house on upstander that one and just arahat a iron belly stove on hansanella to yes i think they do live every one but i northeast back but mostly the anacoluthon and then the big port seems so big an we were little and then jumping off the side of years later when we go back to i will in indelible there passerini etoit and it was like just pastures and sang oh okay ye erything of bigger when you're a little a demeter the bathroom it was scary to showers wastecoat was an old it was like a man and as an older happy at all or else hiding in the back cram and the clothes set out of a and the sagehens on the allonbys roman the checkerboard a anointer what is called in to manethe head drew it came there painted over there and i even take pictures is like but how do they well who was living there at the time that they were in the house for i know the whole to the whole tonal or home making alembert ers and sisters is there in that momentin that roger and rain larry but before beyond motor that was it had to be because the member that's where man got an empire was that there it happetite story on now what is that story o that she lay watching fewer three and then my grandparents had gone to the store and they were supposed to be watching my mom and they weren't paying attention to her and she went and sat a antileon like all over her and nobody noticed that where she was until she started screaming and was cataldi was all gone but verseilles and she was supposed to be watching them but i think mama that was at her house do you remember the foreyard yes when it back on in hat or flowers all the rose bush of rose bushes and different flowers and an when used to fly now it was i but i never came nebiolo or to the house until that to the entire and ninetyeight yes i remember i don't know if it's just from other pictures that of us at uncle betatakin is all the time but i remember the flowers and the foreyard and rumple house in the back the company i remember the first well my memories of her man we were there all intimation of the early ones was a crying and crying so on a denatured fast and no one was going to go get dobrada and ended at making them do you member that i think your remaining now as useter tired but are criticised whatever it was to agonistae up to going to go get any but she desmalions noone i remember so etesian the morning sometimes she made to pattisons oh ye so that we would get a avestar to go to school or just because we and to get out of wonnerin the first like the first time i realized that she could read the insurance man came to the house i was what i remember it remember that i think i was some third like i don't know second or i had to be second peroseed grade and i i guess i was learning like to either spoke my name on a red or something and i asked her something and and then i think mum just distracted me but i looked back might later sheenery i remember i didn't it didn't occur to me but i remember of the insurance man used to come cause she had life insurance and she to pay it a month later on when a water leer something but he came to the house and he was trinette her something in a don't know i i think if i thought she couldn't read it in english but catharine to tell her what it said and then again looking back on a later realized she couldn't she couldn't rain and he think about when i how she grew up and even home mangrove than mamma's on a tolstoyan have a television until she was swept in tempt grade something it so from probably grandma picking cotton too and we know to us being pretty much self sufficient and independent it is cool i mean high school graduates college graduates its just i mean a world of difference between then and now yes which i besmears how much changes or how much has changed since man was growing up to now and how banduri man like i think of how we grew up like e and i you know it that mama thinks goosetree's going to have so much that we don't so much different expert friends have we never had never happened so in some points that is a good decoding and some to work on but good on and then i think she her death certainly was like the first person in my life just that was sore so close to you that am just was devastating nay i think so cause i remember i mean the first person weeks periods but death with was raleigh earlier now notimber than i remember literally there one day in nother the neck and and and but yes and i could i remember josie coming to the house to tell of the note gramachree but i don't remember being as devastated i remember cause i think current date not speaking at the time and we hadn't seen her and a little while or even grandpa lois man yes but just not as close and that one was more you older i mean you are are you heen right he s just turn it to our dismasted right grandma passed away in no clamor of eighty nine then group lois passed away in june of ninety i am just graduated and then grandma was ninety seven eight and distant sin fabriano ninety eight and yes that was yet probably the the hardest one i oneven go to grandpa carolinian he was with them in her to me again he was another picture that was there cause him and dad were close it close and so we weren't we saw him until a man every twice a year until he passed win i think edgar a boy to her you were he at a thousand six ten seven that was oichetai thousands seven and silius before and the ham but yet again for more fortunate the lot of people in the whatten a enowe were in whom he rememorated i school year in toward one so you are emigrant was thought i was so mean it so mean and the green elderton he must like the sweetheart of note were i think we they had tempered him and they know what a boy reboiled en kids i weren't because he have the maxentian the tehooladeree and just i know better in a remernber quiet and low at that was just then gormeston alone was the more dominant personality that i remember him being quiet then i don't i don't know why i think hang it it was his till after they had got divorced and she was had passed that i have more tidetime oris means me too or yer older to be writin spent more time there with them probably iohanan e to be quick as that was in close susan he didn't want to i guess have the same regret of what happened when grimaces to tresham so and then just taking everything as i may i unaiding and stories about when he was in the army and going out again joe cotton and stories sometimes have won they are intimacies were younger than trouble insanguinar le your member of that inferiority i know taguanate army stories sees to like to talk about his friends and i actually talk about any like i do think they were the war the time he was in he was in a m it was orderto and he was on the south creating as mike and the gaberdines part not europe it was the ever the other cops would i remember the picture of him in renomination and our member being shocked at that picture has then he had his head aramis or meat and that in that he looked a lot like dad who cause they have fame must same faintlier and they are the heirs and i remember taking ben to see him from the first time water yes that thanksgiving yes and he was an you wasn't a tiny baby but he was old enough to hear late to be blind or five palacio at people on yeshibot was i think which is important to me and that i am quite we were that close to them all of them i think and i think these just result of a thin man bingles or her mom and dad been listed her dad sole were there time so i don't want to my alstad and i think that will be hell tangadala to him to her through her maman and then close to moise parents too so i and tell cushites see i know all spring to yasine will be an tis for the ass again or me you already at the unnoticed want to lose that those memories and make sure that we don't forget them in that and have them and where we distantlie him then as we get older we don't forget i am not going to fineable to take him herself not mean what else i think that's everything was like the biggest without important pieces at one of her past the sunday or going to be grand career has for her heritieres like antinous by minute that we have about the family within it was were always a big family but close a this begins we were an both of our parents had tenableness we were we were as close with weobly could be being in different cities and not too many cities but that we were we all knew each other and that we were close and that we knew everything about what was going on and our history or how our negro and work grapestone from my parents came from the south think you
