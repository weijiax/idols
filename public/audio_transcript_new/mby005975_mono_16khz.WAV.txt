tore torus or tourism fit an fifty six years old to day as loving her nineteenth two thousand nine and the location chosen texas and i am the interview week great well thanks for coming in a really excited a toffee like right heart a little glimpse of stories um but i want to start at the beginning i guess can you tell me a little bit about your parents yes my parents were born in perico in the sun and some tousandth were their names are then at nestoria and that was dorians so they were born there but grew up in new york and in new york it was the great depression which everybody knows about and there was a very hard time for my parents in number one on my father's side his father was a protestant preacher and he came to new york so he connecteth as professor at a university somewhere new york city we we sudn't know where that is he on my mother's side her father was a carpenter and so he would travel to different cities or even islands so by mother with bonitoes but my my uncle the oldest one he still lived his ninety one his last family member he was born in the dominican republic so as very interesting to hear those in an dat's how they got to new york and live in harlem but it was not calepache that time it was just harlem and it was a mix of different ethnic groups so how old were our mom and died when they came to new york my mother was two years old so she doesn't remember anything of the island and my father was about ten and do you remember your grandparents no ah well morandot er yes but not my grandfather's for this reason in new york when a mother was about five she did really know her father much but he he died when she was about five years old and let father i don't know how old he was maybe twelve something like that but he had to so he was ten when i left and boutwell years old when his father died so i ever met my grandfather so then that would happen was a had two families of course it did know each other but they would seem the mother's where he had a family with five six children during the great depression and not fluent in english both from pretoria both moved to new york put recurrit exactly where in new york did they lived in harlem it lived in harlotries parts of her east and west harlem to what did they tell you do they ever talk about growing up during that oppression and what that was like in in harlem yes i mabot was a story teller so i end up with more stories on her side and one of the vivid memories i have is she said they was joy so hungry that when she's going to school or coming home from school she would stop by maybe the bankers and they would give them left over pastries or she would go digging into a garbage can and one day she found a sandwich it was he a hard boiled egg on which but as all rotten but she ate it fish he was so hungry and forever after cause ever hester we would when you making those easter eggs she would say i can't stand this a hard well leg and she wouldn't eat him but that was so that we never got to forget that that was very you know she could taste and feel just as if it happened that moment in those of this rememberest with you forever right did it did did they come from big family of they have a lot of brothers and sisters well a my mother's side think a confused five on one side and i think of my mother's with five shell she had that's the issue one of them died early and so i never better so that's why i could confuse but numbers so i think i boldsides actually they had six and the youngest die but she was no twenties so anesi never met her so that pasagarda ther's my grandmother had to the brave six children in infinis to support them and and that's where the stores also overinterested yet how did they do that on my mother's side i know that they had to be that all the children had be sent to boarding school a four feears probably all about onnoth were always together may be a couple of or together and also later on foster homes a memoir didn't have any good memories about the postrema i have nothing other than she didn't like it said he she wun't she that ship from one place to the other so she wouldn't talk about it well no i i just never occurred to me that time to ask the questions now were more were fosters and the doptin so it just we didn't never thought about that she had a little bit more on the stories of the boarding school in runner and i i did alicea hit it doesn't exist but the records are there because i was just sent an email about that what are some of her stories from the time well it was a real saint benedict what is called oke so it was a religious school and she liked the nuns it's a thigh was okay with it meet there also religious as of the tomesha none in another place so was hard to tell but every member some mary's about school whether as a boarding school or in new york oh as she was some one who would speak her mind the chest would like her because she's very intelligent but they couldn't show favouritism so when she spoke her mind she would get punished and it's pretty much like i heard yes he can have the wouldn'ter wrapped in your hands or you can have your paul down and you get smacked on your back and front a whole class with older a paddle as paddled so that as a a when the aspects of growing up there a whole that there for moment and returned to my father because all the remember as i said i don't have very many stories on my father's side see that he grew up but what do you get to press and he had to drop out a school so he didn't get to continue his education also the really big issue that had a major influence on his life and arliss is that when his father died he was not going to get goat college at all good would have a free who was guaranteed to free college education because his father were being university but once his father died that was gone so and we don't know whether he ever went back to school or not we just know that he eaout eighth grade and that he may be graduated from high school maybe not but he was very intelligent he loved reading and he loved history so did he have to get a job then at a grattelard the family or yes and i don't remember it what jobs he did that's all i remember a pegion the tourist i we don't have very minute stories although i just learn to shear my cousin's nose some more so untouristed we haven't been a touch much so that's all i know he dropped out he wasn't going to get his college education and then well get to those different stories of how that impacted their educations and their dreams by so your mother finished that she monothelite she graduated the one year of college i don't remember what course you took her where she went but she she did work for a wall and let sposo back to okay so we now know where they are in terms of great depression growing up and he whether issued or my mother's mother did i arieto job to finally bring all her children back from the foster homes boarding schools she learned to make leather straps for cars ohod on or vaguely remember seeing something like that and also she would cook food and she would sell it to people in the neighborhood so there was a stack of the bill me if when i envisage it it something like topperer stack up but it would be all metal and the cooked and then deliver it and my mother would help her you know what she would not well will be the porrenos so latona's a rosycheeks like that you rises very important and gondolas another kind of riser very special to part recante so what happened when the whole family was able to be back together again then they were able to go to school complete their ucation beat together and grow nephoris growing on the harlem toutelles in new york for quite a while where did your parents met in that they were in the neighbourhood and so they were teenager out this good that you ask that and i remember my mother saying that she saw this guy and he didn't call himself bernieres he were some reason called himself tony which she said she remembered seeing this guy walking down the street and the way he walked in and wait at walking on the balls of his feet i guess really jauntin that really caught her eye she really like that so now i have to tell you something about my mother okay i'm going to tell you the best story she never ayolas ladened i understand why would like it but i think you'll understand i would like it and it's going to relate to something with my father later on i give you sansom mother i told her she would be very direct and in and she knew how to be one thing i delaroo's had to fight and in school they would kiss what come up and say you meteetse and her be a fight my mother would go home faussett those kids are both you is not that you do anything they dissected to fight for you so my mother thought and she go home and her remoter would be all so with her casemates hair was be all messed up you know onderclothes mauperin mother would be on a ericapeus my mother's tenasserim she just didn't have up preciate spanish at that time but anyway it was so that was one of the things that she had we all had to deal eventually is learn had a fight i mean fist fight and i remember my uncle took totter out to fight okay so now here's the story my mother and now there it by parassault and working so there about eighteen nineteen twenty something like that in my mother had just got paid i don't remember what job i was jerking a factory for a while but she'd got just gotten paid and so she was going to her mother's apartment and i remember the brown stone so i can visualize his very well cause she went up she sat his third floor and she went up and knocked on the door and waited for some one to come to the door and as she was doing this a someone a man came up the steps and then he went up to the next story emma my the way didn't no one was coming to the door so it happened was the man suddenly comes racing down he grabbed my mother's purse and my mother jumps on his back and hooked his gather arm squeezed round his neck and she screaming a screaming as she's very angry you know so he really at an she would not lie over hers and she would not like o that man so down they go three stories and finally the bottom a guy couldn't take it any more heat through her purse aside and ran out the front of the building she went to a person make sure all her money was there and then she went out to look for him she looked she said when i get angry i just see red so i don't i'm not thinking and she looked up again as she was if she saw her go she was going to go after it's incredible and as he was going down the street these other young men were looking at her and whistling to her and she just gave him durok like dangers come from her eyes then i right so the story now is now you get a sense of my mother so here it is she makes my father and she really likes him and they go to some dance somewhere and but my father i i don't know my mother came and later or a what but i remember my father was with another woman to another young woman and my mother is like that she went over and she punched the woman get out of it myriametres my father a better will atterworthy so you'll see that that sort of the fiendish runs in her family and and these are emportement that carried on because as my parents you it when they became apparent we had to learn how to fight and fend erself do you remember any stories that sort of show that ficinus and your mother when you were growing up like you member seeing that come out the itsell it was parer character she would tell people what they think of beyint behave properly she though just so many times that she would just shoot she didn't do wasn't afraid of telling me what they should be doing no inkling yet yet well she try but she also understood the now that i had my own dreams now my mother would always talk back to a hermathenae in bad ways but my mother wanted me all her own person well that's what i have to shoestring up and my mother at one point wanted to give me some lady for something and i said no i well i i didn't say no first i she said on gave it his money but only if you don't spend it on school and i said no then i don't want it and you socrates toioutous and dollars and on staying now because she would condition on it that why i'm here let you defend it on school i all get to the calalate on to you now i jump the had little bit so my parents do not my parents are married my father goes to war and he was in the south pacific he was a ready man and actually here's what my both my parents will want it my father wanted to write yeself being in the army and my mother wanted to be a writer she loved poetry she read poetry to us she sang songs to us which she learned this in school as well she wants to be a flying reporter now the funny thing is later on she said you know she went to fly around report to the sword but she you i don't like spying in well i don't know what i was then i don't like hands at all but still the tradition was a missus something a rope moveing to my mother as an adult she said the tradition was he get married and he have kids and so on so the man hammy older istubar nineteen forty six that in the i came and i can fifty three so there's a seven or difference and then a third sister three years after me and so we grew up in harlem well we outliving the good question okay so my parents had i was born in manhattan and then shortly they are after is not clear weather i was he lived in the harlem the first few months of my life but we moved to a house in project in north bronx and i remember that place so in it still exists and i think his brand new whatyouwantoeat it opened up to months after i was born what do you remember about it it was break and about three or four stories high it was by water and its a swamp and there is but an head there was pretty open i mean i can't say it was really pretty but had pretty boothes concrete and bushes and around so that i was about five and a half and then we moved from there into tone or new jersey as been a few years there and and when i was nine and a half we moved to a little town in a jersey called souther so that's really where grew up from the eight nine and a half until thirty that's what i finally left out for so they wanted to be writers but were they able to do that or i father couldn't because he well i can said i don't even know whether he has a high school diploma so when he what he was trying to do was different jobs he tried to strike business is a dentated machinery equipment something like selling it and then another one something about cooking utensil potpan things like that and those didn't work out so he found the ended up as a truck parts fit salesman and he was never happy with that but he loved to read history and my mother didn't pursue any writing cure chrissie was busy raising family and that just wasn't something i thought about any more when she galinette other mothers and all that that wasn't the time period but you know the love of that was passed on to us so then we have so now we're all in south farrieries if you can remember any of the poems or songs that you are tell you to um ah yes i could remember one song that we would ask her every year to sing and somewhere i have it recorded on videotape hope confined it but to spring time and always on the first day spring she was in a on a been able to find it a spring is here i can't think so i'm not doing it spring his years the earth the joy is and i don't remember the rest of the worst case we always had her sing it so that was passed on and my sister pass it might youngish passed it on to her daughter to that was the one thing that is i and she would read to us as well but education was important and as i said my father read a lot he is loved history and his favorite time periods were american revolution and a civil war even though we had no relatives in is at that time period ran he was fascinated by that because that also the time purring in and others were told to assimilate to real parachute off and he sent to your your heritage so my mother didn't speak spanish very well because at shesto and she said i'm in this country now what need that language for where my father could speak spanish fluently but they asked us one time at home do you want a suspeeshons at home unfortunately we gave the same response pretty much as my mother so we didn't speak spanish at home so we would be better but i did grow up hearing it from my relatives and i'm the last family member bralinra hold on to that and i like it back to the history because every year week on vacation so my father even all we weren't a amiddle clash o probably maybe lower middle class may be dancing into that no man but we would always go to vacation on vacation for a week every year and it always included a battle field so i have been to every single battle field in american revolution and civil war while yes meat and our job was to go looking for bullets you know been a long time since they heathenising were supposed to look at these big open field and ground for bullets did you enjoy that oh well i don't remember so much looking bullets i just remember seeing the different places and knowing that his importance in the late run school course i could relate to them much better because i've been there yes so that was up that's how my father continues educational was reading and going to the battle field what were the vacations like were they that it aileen the car and they were a sort of loud road trips or that it had question to that do remember that now thevenin it we went seems to be we would get up too early in the morning it was dark out and we'd get up and pilot the car and go traveling off and who stayed a motel so i loved being in a car and i love travelling long throat and just looking out but we my sister and i would have some little get caramella along the way but i was just fastening different places and being in a different motel every single night how how did you get along with your mom and dad differently i mean date was one more strict than the other no but i was asgill and i put it this way as i said my parents had dreams but they didn't get to complete their dreams so their dreams for education was put into their children so we i we all complete high school and we just studied and were hard a forgot what they had lost tracery the question how they were all the trouties my okay colossial yea and a really think he he really missed out i'm not going to college i think that was the one thing but one of the things in that not tonisa in the army noting able to see an army i think those affected him so in a way he was allowing me to finish or continue the dreams we want to learn how to fly an airplane he had a friend who flew well hen take lessons i was the one that took lessons i've got into civil airport and they they had an airplane i learned to fly and airplane before i learned a dropical there gave that opportunity to test because he had the opportunity to fly he knew some one and i remember that the friend took us to some airport at i don't remember where it was it i was too young to really related to where we're going but we did do that and so he didn't get the fly and later on a digitalis license and see what else also heating had got college so i was the first one to go to college and complete education how did you know how did they show that education was so important like how do you know that the will you regler measles of the what the backgrounds were that held heart was i to struggle in outgoing job said they wanted to get him a mother to work eventually in a factory in in south river and shells worked as an office manager so they really didn't get to be who they really wanted to be and my father actually started to write stories about the world war two and he had sent one off to a little magazine but it was three years later and he was already dead before i got published and somewhere i still had i have one of stores i also have my mother's a few of my mother's palms i didn't know about it to feesage now dead too that i found these night put up website and what my gold is to have them those published along with some things for myself to is not enough for upon themselves and so that they would have etalage published but a man thing though did you know at the time that you and riding potrei know she did occasionally but i leewee old so i don't think she do was hoosegow up what she did painted pastels in fact i was just out naroon at to pick up some of those i had em said you to hang in our home since too large passed ills so i want so art was also that you know in the family and my father was a photographer i think he did that when i was so much younger and adorem er but i'm of a togather that's why do i wait i remember that but i my mother it had actually had a dark room so that was so much before and all eydent your blood without you knowing it right oh yeah and i had a picture of me when i thought you and a half old that those photo sculpture they call now what were your interest like what did you want to be when you grow up and and had you enjoy school did you like education was that something you were happy to persusaive science and my dream was well etooelle story on me now this is in new york and it was a t b show most people don't remember and was called super car and it was about a card that could fly in the air going to water i thought that was the coolest thing whatsoever so i thought that i wanted to have that car and i want it to have that car but i thought the only way could get to get it is if i married the the character and incarcerated outfits about the way these are all patent real people as one thought have to marry you marry my marker in care about him i want the caroline i don't have to have him i can get a car lassockie so i once a fly and i like science fiction i was very much a deep day dreamer so what i wanted to be when i grew up with a one as to national and yes i am a start rick fan from nineteen o six to some one of the originals so i wanted to be an ashen and that's why i wanted to similar patrol i was in the girl scouts for a while but when we learned of civil arbitration make a fellow students then i joined that and i went through that foot three and half four years what is that exactly what does that mean what are you going through civil air patrols actually is evil and ailery of the air force so kin so it's not quite like the girl as they actually did perform duties during world war two it flew long they had a little paper coves that flew up and down the coast looking fruit submarines ok so and they do search in rescue missions going into the woods so we learn all that in sociological we actually did learn survival training we actually were sent out on a mission of grawe were only teenagers but they were trained to do this to be able to survive in the woods bealach for people now here's the down side this was the nineteen sixties and hear im with all the guys i am ignescent some girls in there too and were all trained to sam and the girls usually did better than the guys and when it came to an a real search and rescue mission we've the girls were not allowed to go in and searched the woods we had to sit outside on blanketwise coffee and wait and wait and we we did express our anger but there was nothing we could do about they were not going to let us in that hall we were all yes it is it really is said i that in still like a fierce feminist streak inside you moving forward or don't forget whom i mother was right even though she did untraditional job my mother yet and a strong sense of herself if i lose that i was really much shyer quieter when i was going self conscious but on the other hand i was very observant of people's behavior storing as i was growing up so that also shaped my ideas in my dreams that i didn't have to depend on someone else is not that i didn't want ordinating it was good idea it's just that i saw women who would say it when i would tell my dreams they would say oh girls grim's dreams never come true or they say oh you'll get married and have kids and they weren't saying in a happy tone and your am listening in the why what i do something that wouldn't make me happy and those are really stuck with me and i had so i had to really indorse social othah became quiet after all i want to hear any of this because i couldn't really i do not handle it i do want them to change my mind so i just kept quiet with my dreams and i just just decided that i was going to do what i want to do do you know didn't matter with what other people said this is what i wanted to so i pursued those in with that encouragement from my parents to so i did go similarities major we did learn what are space wet that time i still have the book that here's the funniest thing and i didn't discover it till about twenty five years ago so your is nineteen sixties and we have this book similar patrol are space and it was put out by some squadron and then i moved down here in nineteen eighty four down houston texas from new jersey and i was pulling out some books when i look and i saw that book and when i looked at the bottom it said it was published by the ellington field squadron a sainete mole otalora actually published the book i had learned from in the sixties on any jersey so these very strange coincidence is yet so i believe very much to dreams are very important and you really have the whole fast but people are always going to be there to help you so you really have to know what you want you have to learn a lot and some learn had overcome your fears because then here's how i would do it if there was something i wanted to do i would think well cause i might be a title spare cause i never done it and people wouldn't nessary understand what it wooant do i don't outsetting to myself how would i feel if i never did it and if i have felt that i could i would always regret it then i would make myself go ahead and do it and i would always feel ill right i i really i accomplish this so no regrets at least i did it so you in turn out way at least i i did it but that was a really important to me so it was similar bartolas one of those hens to was one of those things that you are scared of that you went for that your most proud of looking back now as i said i was very self conscious and so actually speaking in public or recieve have people around out affected feel emotions very easily and assented if i think that's what makes a good writer artist or human being in general that i had to overcome that that really sense of fear and my mother had some of that too you know she was very alboin i told you she didn't like to fly so she would try to hold a suppressed her fears for me i can tell she did not be dusting and she would but then she told back cause she knew i had to find my own way just like she used spoke alice he couldn't do it to make you want it to meet be my own person can we hear the story now about how she was going to give you money but didn't want it for college yes i hear that there are many stories in between but i was ouray had one college degree in an as go from my masters degree and i had out well act out with no the story but that was after challenger so i wasn't working at nesta time so i wanted to continue with my education because i just loved learning and but i didn't have much money so she wanted to give me money to help me live in osterman who will eat food things like that which i did too but putting restrictions on atoast out that's where i started be more like my mother that i re care that that was by what her yearly money i didn't care the lady i don't want restrict you place on me it but that's what she she respected that it took her back she was very surprised oh but then she and she told me this later on its right didn't happen at that moment but later on you know she said and then i thought about it she said if i reimposition that's exactly what i would have done so but as a mother she couldn't see to mediately but then when she switched around probably a few days i don't know when she can tell me at the time she told me what later that it was she realised was behaving this like earlswood get the money if you and i did continue it for school yes i do so did you become an ashman i didn't become an astronaut but i came pretty darn clothes to go up a little girl from a small town in a time period were the worn latencies or roots for girls to go from south of in a jersey yet my education there also start my first job into space injury in the street ingerstein to university on a saleport which stand gave me the skills for work in it the johnson space enter so i have worked in supporting both the space shuttle and intentional space station programmes so i have worked in mission control misionarios i had gin prints as are most not direct boss i have been part of so much history you you your sideristen here and there's all the sister wanted to burst out but we can't but i do you ses for where my parents came from and i did get my pile i since as he said when i was about twenty four something like that so active had it for me over twenty five years be maybe costeth rty yeah yeah that's right go to thirty years i don't fly because i can't afford but i learned a flying a piper cub those the lair plans in his eliot don't of one of those flippancies i did get to de fly yet my license i tried to go waiving almost got my like since they are but i did achieve a lot and to end up where i never thought of nassington at but when i came here for an interview and i saw a head do with people i saw although horse this makes sense was i was look at it gartersnake enter in maryland and and when i came down here that for nineve i knew instantly this arid to be so have worked here a well worked in jonson space enter and met asked not from every single us space program and some of them are dead now i was at naso during challenger in fact i was supposed to be sitting in missikota but it was an option and i had some some other work i need to do so i have a lot and i i was riding journals i have a hundred eighteen journals and some of them have really tremendous stories in em and autographs i take as he said of foot photographer now i just moved into another house and setting up so now beginning processing all this together all these augustos my paris and he a space program but it's just been awesome but it wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for my parents and of course their parents it would have been different may ave been some place else at my father benwell get a college education you would be something different but he i think i did really well for going over coming so much within myself but i want i know i remember how hard it was and still is at times and that's the point of my life i as i saw how my parents struggled and to see other people not just children other family struggling the same way my parents had told long ago that the gold of my life is yesterday's exciting adventurous things but to come back and share it night i have done this over the past most of my life fastens a teenager and go different ways but that's the whole point was is to go to a program like this at this is as if my whole life has been building up to the point of being here because this is exactly what i'm doing right now with my journals my photographs if if people were to listen to this or two to read your journals and get a sense of who you are what do you think what would you hope they would take away legless and they would take away for their own life that i'm just a human being like anybody else you don't have to be a super person to achieve such great dreams is being the part of i've talked to people in here on this base station or also worked with the programs to be to be able to do something so big that it you can do it and i tell this to people all the time because i've done a lot of programs a lot different ages and seen to it in my home town i got to do it for all the school late i sit in just like you had teachers just like this this is wherritted and so anybody could and i want to in still that and bring out the creativity and all the strength you need to do it because it is not been easy it really has not been easy and i would just like to end with one note if i may i wore a chain and held it a cry because my sister my younger sister died this year at estalle ould be fifty three so i would live her gentoo she was fitness train as he died for me as i had to be there to take care of her so as he said this a lot a story but it takes a lot of strength to watch people you love died field take care of him and then dionine on so yes it is this this work is important and so i appreciate the opportunity to be here really deeply appreciate that opportunity who really appreciate the fortune to interview you thank you so much for coming in thank you
